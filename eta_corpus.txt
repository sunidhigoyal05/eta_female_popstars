'All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor\'92s Version) [From The Vault]'\
\
\
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house\
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now\
\
[Verse 2]\
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate\
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place\
And I can picture it after all these days\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And I know it's long gone and\
That magic's not here no more\
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\
Oh, oh, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
'Caus\uc0\u1077  there we ar\u1077  again on that little town street\
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\
Wind in my hair, I was there\
I remember it all too well\
\
[Verse 3]\
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red\
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me\
And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"\
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town\
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now\
He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was\
'Til we were dead and gone and buried\
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same\
After three months in the grave\
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you\
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And I know it's long gone and\
There was nothing else I could do\
And I forget about you long enough\
To forget why I needed to\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\
Down the stairs, I was there\
I remember it all too well\
And there we are again when nobody had to know\
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath\
Sacred prayer and we'd swear\
To remember it all too well, yeah\
\
[Bridge]\
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much\
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up\
Runnin' scared, I was there\
I remember it all too well\
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise\
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest\
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here\
'Cause I remember it all, all, all\
[Verse 4]\
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell\
Every time you double-cross my mind\
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine\
And that made me want to die\
The idea you had of me, who was she?\
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you\
Not weepin' in a party bathroom\
Some actress askin' me what happened, you\
That's what happened, you\
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show\
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come\
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"\
\
[Verse 5]\
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it\
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone\
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week\
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\
You can't get rid of it\
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\
It was rare, I was there\
I remember it all too well\
Wind in my hair, you were there\
You remember it all\
Down the stairs, you were there\
You remember it all\
It was rare, I was there\
I remember it all too well\
[Verse 6]\
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes\
"I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"\
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight\
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?\
'Cause in this city's barren cold\
I still remember the first fall of snow\
And how it glistened as it fell\
I remember it all too well\
\
[Outro]\
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?\
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well\
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)\
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there\
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there\
It was rare, you remember it all too well\
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)\
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)\
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there\
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)\
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there\
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there\
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there\
It was rare, you remember it\
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there\
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there\

'\uc0\u8203 cardigan'\
\
\
When you are young, they assume you know\uc0\u8197 nothing\
Sequin\uc0\u8197 smile, black lipstick\
Sensual\uc0\u8197 politics\
When you are young, they assume\uc0\u8197 you know nothing\
\
[Chorus]\
But I knew you\
Dancin' in your Levi's\
Drunk under a streetlight, I\
I knew you\
Hand under my sweatshirt\
Baby, kiss it better, I\
\
[Refrain]\
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan\
Under someone's bed\
You put me on and said I was your favorite\
\
[Verse 2]\
A friend to all is a friend to none\
Chase two girls, lose the one\
When you are young, they assume you know nothing\
[Chorus]\
But I knew you\
Playing hide-and-seek and\
Giving me your weekends, I\
I knew you\
Your heartbeat on the High Line\
Once in twenty lifetimes, I\
\
[Refrain]\
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan\
Under someone's bed\
You put me on and said I was your favorite\
\
[Bridge]\
To kiss in cars and downtown bars\
Was all we needed\
You drew stars around my scars\
But now I'm bleedin'\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause I knew you\
Steppin' on the last train\
Marked me like a bloodstain, I\
I knew you\
Tried to change the ending\
Peter losing Wendy, I\
I knew you\
Leavin' like a father\
Running like water, I\
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing\
[Verse 3]\
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss\
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs\
The smell of smoke would hang around this long\
'Cause I knew everything when I was young\
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time\
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line\
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired\
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light\
And I knew you'd come back to me\
You'd come back to me\
And you'd come back to me\
And you'd come back\
\
[Refrain]\
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan\
\
\
\
'Lover'\
\
\
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear\
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?\
[Chorus]\
Can I go where you go?\
Can we always be this close?\
Forever and ever, ah\
Take me out and take me home\
You're my, my, my, my lover\
\
[Verse 2]\
We could let our friends crash in the living room\
This is our place, we make the call\
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you\
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all\
[Chorus]\
Can I go where you go?\
Can we always be this close?\
Forever and ever, ah\
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)\
You're my, my, my, my lover\
[Bridge]\
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?\
With every guitar string scar on my hand\
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover\
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue\
All's well that ends well to end up with you\
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover\
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me\
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover\
[Chorus]\
Can I go where you go?\
Can we always be this close?\
Forever and ever, ah\
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)\
You're my, my, my, my\

'Is It Over Now? (Taylor\'92s Version) [From The Vault]'\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)\
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)\
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)\
You still wouldn't go\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later\
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters\
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor\
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby\
\
[Chorus]\
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?\
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?\
"Come here," I whispered in your ear\
In your dream as you pass\uc0\u1077 d out, baby\
Was it over then? And is it over now?\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\
\
[Verse 2]\
Wh\uc0\u1077 n you lost control (Uh-huh)\
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)\
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)\
Your new girl is my clone\
[Bridge]\
And did you think I didn't see you?\
There were flashin' lights\
At least I had the decency\
To keep my nights out of sight\
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs\
And my whispered sighs\
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'\
Off of very tall somethings\
Just to see you come runnin'\
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)\
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)\
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)\
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby\
\
[Chorus]\
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?\
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?\
"Come here," I whispered in your ear\
In your dream as you passed out, baby\
Was it over then? And is it over now?\
[Post-Chorus]\
Uh-huh\
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)\
Uh-huh\
(Is it? Is it?)\
[Bridge]\
Think I didn't see you?\
There were flashin' lights\
At least I had the decency\
To keep my nights out of sight\
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs\
And my whispered sighs\
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'\
Off of very tall somethings\
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')\
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no\
\
[Outro]\
(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)\
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)\
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there\
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)\
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)\
\
\
\
'\uc0\u8203 the 1'\
\
\
I thought I\uc0\u8197 saw\u8197 you at the\u8197 bus stop, I didn't though\
I hit\uc0\u8197 the ground running each night\
I hit the Sunday matin\'e9e\
You know the greatest films of all time were never made\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I guess you never know, never know\
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed\
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow\
And it's alright now\
\
[Chorus]\
But we were something, don't you think so?\
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool\
And if my wishes came true\
It would've been you\
In my defense, I have none\
For never leaving well enough alone\
But it would've been fun\
If you would've been the one\
(Ooh)\
\
[Verse 2]\
I have this dream you're doing cool shit\
Having adventures on your own\
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home\
We never painted by the numbers, baby\
But we were making it count\
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I guess you never know, never know\
And it's another day waking up alone\
\
[Chorus]\
But we were something, don't you think so?\
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool\
And if my wishes came true\
It would've been you\
In my defense, I have none\
For never leaving well enough alone\
But it would've been fun\
If you would've been the one\
\
[Bridge]\
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you\
If one thing had been different\
Would everything be different today?\
\
[Chorus]\
We were something, don't you think so?\
Ros\'e9 flowing with your chosen family\
And it would've been sweet\
If it could've been me\
In my defense, I have none\
For digging up the grave another time\
But it would've been fun\
\

\
'\uc0\u8203 august'\
\
\
Whispers of "Are you\uc0\u8197 sure?"\
"Never\uc0\u8197 have I ever\u8197 before"\
\
[Chorus]\
But I can see us lost\uc0\u8197 in the memory\
August slipped away into a moment in time\
'Cause it was never mine\
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets\
August sipped away like a bottle of wine\
'Cause you were never mine\
\
[Verse 2]\
Your back beneath the sun\
Wishin' I could write my name on it\
Will you call when you're back at school?\
I remember thinkin' I had you\
\
[Chorus]\
But I can see us lost in the memory\
August slipped away into a moment in time\
'Cause it was never mine\
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets\
August sipped away like a bottle of wine\
'Cause you were never mine\
[Bridge]\
Back when we were still changin' for the better\
Wanting was enough\
For me, it was enough\
To live for the hope of it all\
Cancel plans just in case you'd call\
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"\
So much for summer love and saying "us"\
'Cause you weren't mine to lose\
You weren't mine to lose, no\
\
[Chorus]\
But I can see us lost in the memory\
August slipped away into a moment in time\
'Cause it was never mine\
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets\
August sipped away like a bottle of wine\
'Cause you were never mine\
\
[Outro]\
'Cause you were never mine\
Never mine\
But do you remember?\
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"\
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?\
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all\
"Meet me behind the mall"\
(Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car")\
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)\
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)\
("Meet me behind the mall")\
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"\
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?\
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)\

'Cruel Summer'\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night\
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)\
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price\
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Killing me slow, out the window\
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below\
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes\
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more\
\
[Chorus]\
And it's new, the shape of your body\
It's blue, the feeling I've got\
And it's ooh, woah-oh\
It's a cruel summer\
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em\
No rules in breakable heaven\
But ooh, woah-oh\
It's a cruel summer with you\
\
[Verse 2]\
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine\
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)\
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times\
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)\
[Pre-Chorus]\
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife\
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone\
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes\
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
It's new, the shape of your body\
It's blue, the feeling I've got\
And it's ooh, woah-oh\
It's a cruel summer\
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em\
No rules in breakable heaven\
But ooh, woah-oh\
It's a cruel summer with you\
\
[Bridge]\
I'm drunk in the back of the car\
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)\
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true\
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you\
And I snuck in through the garden gate\
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)\
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth\
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"\
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil\
[Chorus]\
It's new, the shape of your body\
It's blue, the feeling I've got\
And it's ooh, woah-oh\
It's a cruel summer\
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em\
No rules in breakable heaven\
But ooh, woah-oh\
It's a cruel summer with you\
\
[Outro]\
I'm drunk in the back of the car\
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)\
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true\
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you\
And I snuck in through the garden gate\
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)\
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth\

\
'\uc0\u8203 tolerate it'\
\
\
I sit and watch you\
I notice everything you do or don't do\
You're so much older and wiser, and I\
\
[Chorus]\
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid\
Use my best colors for your portrait\
Lay the table with the fancy shit\
And watch you tolerate it\
If it's all in my head, tell me now\
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow\
I know my love should be celebrated\
But you tolerate it\
\
[Verse 2]\
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome\
I take your indiscretions all in good fun\
I sit and list\uc0\u1077 n\
I polish plates until they gleam and glist\uc0\u1077 n\
You're so much older and wiser, and I\
\
[Chorus]\
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid\
Use my best colors for your portrait\
Lay the table with the fancy shit\
And watch you tolerate it\
If it's all in my head, tell me now\
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow\
I know my love should be celebrated\
But you tolerate it\
[Bridge]\
While you were out buildin' other worlds, where was I?\
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?\
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky\
Now I'm beggin' for footnotes in the story of your life\
Drawin' hearts in the byline\
Always takin' up too much space or time\
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I (I)\
\
[Chorus]\
Break free and leave us in ruins?\
Took this dagger in me and removed it\
Gain the weight of you, then lose it\
Believe me, I could do it\
If it's all in my head, tell me now\
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow\
I know my love should be celebrated\
But you tolerate it\
\
\
\
\
'Look What You Made Me Do'\
\
\
The role you made me play\
Of the fool, no, I don't like you\
I don't like your perfect crime\
How you laugh when you lie\
You said the gun was mine\
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh)\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time\
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time\
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined\
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
Ooh, look what you made me do\
Look what you made me do\
Look what you just made me do\
Look what you just made me\
Ooh, look what you made me do\
Look what you made me do\
Look what you just made me do\
Look what you just made me do\
[Verse 2]\
I (I) don't (Don't) like your kingdom keys (Keys)\
They (They) once belonged to me (Me)\
You (You) asked me for a place to sleep\
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)\
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama\
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma\
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure\
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (Nick of time)\
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time (I do it all the time)\
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined\
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
Ooh, look what you made me do\
Look what you made me do\
Look what you just made me do\
Look what you just made me\
Ooh, look what you made me do\
Look what you made me do\
Look what you just made me do\
Look what you just made me do\
[Bridge]\
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me\
I'll be the actress starrin' in your bad dreams\
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me\
I'll be the actress starrin' in your bad dreams\
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me\
I'll be the actress starrin' in your bad dreams\
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me\
I'll be the actress starrin' in your bad dreams\
\
[Interlude]\
(Ooh, look what you made me do)\
(Look what you made me do)\
(Look what you just made me do)\
(Look what you just made me)\
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now"\
(Ooh, look what you made me do)\
(Look what you made me do)\
(Look what you just made me)\
"Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead" (Oh)\

Ooh, look what you made me do\
Look what you made me do\
Look what you just made me do\
Look what you just made me\
Ooh, look what you made me do\

'\uc0\u8203 champagne problems'\
\
\
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers\
You're not sure which is worse\
\
[Chorus]\
Because I dropped your hand while dancing\
Left you\uc0\u8287 out\u8287 there\u8287 standing\
Crestfallen on the\uc0\u8287 landing\
Champagne problems\
Your mom's ring in your pocket\
My picture in your wallet\
Your heart was glass, I dropped it\
Champagne problems\
\
[Verse 2]\
You told your family for a reason\
You couldn't keep it in\
Your sister splashed out on the bottle\
Now no one's celebrating\
\
[Chorus]\
Dom P\'e9rignon, you brought it\
No crowd of friends applauded\
Your hometown skeptics called it\
Champagne problems\
You had a speech, you're speechless\
Love slipped beyond your reaches\
And I couldn't give a reason\
Champagne problems\
[Bridge]\
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door\
November flush and your flannel cure\
"This dorm was once a madhouse"\
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"\
How evergreen, our group of friends\
Don't think we'll say that word again\
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls\
That we once walked through\
One for the money, two for the show\
I never was ready so I watch you go\
Sometimes you just don't know the answer\
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you\
"She would've made such a lovely bride\
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said\
But you'll find the real thing instead\
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred\
\
[Chorus]\
And hold your hand while dancing\
Never leave you standing\
Crestfallen on the landing\
With champagne problems\
Your mom's ring in your pocket\
Her picture in your wallet\
You won't remember all my\
Champagne problems\

'\uc0\u8203 betty'\
\
\
I think it's 'cause of\uc0\u8197 me\
Betty,\uc0\u8197 one time, I\u8197 was riding on my skateboard\
When I passed your house\
It's like I couldn't breathe\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
You heard the rumors from Inez\
You can't believe a word she says\
Most times, but this time, it was true\
The worst thing that I ever did\
Was what I did to you\
\
[Chorus]\
But if I just showed up at your party\
Would you have me? Would you want me?\
Would you tell me to go fuck myself\
Or lead me to the garden?\
In the garden, would you trust me\
If I told you it was just a summer thing?\
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\
But I know I miss you\
\
[Verse 2]\
Betty, I know where it all went wrong\
Your favorite song was playing\
From the far side of the gym\
I was nowhere to be found\
I hate the crowds, you know that\
Plus, I saw you dance with him\
[Pre-Chorus]\
You heard the rumors from Inez\
You can't believe a word she says\
Most times, but this time, it was true\
The worst thing that I ever did\
Was what I did to you\
\
[Chorus]\
But if I just showed up at your party\
Would you have me? Would you want me?\
Would you tell me to go fuck myself\
Or lead me to the garden?\
In the garden, would you trust me\
If I told you it was just a summer thing?\
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\
But I know I miss you\
\
[Bridge]\
I was walking home on broken cobblestones\
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like\
A figment of my worst intentions\
She said, "James, get in, let's drive"\
Those days turned into nights\
Slept next to her, but\
I dreamt of you all summer long\
[Verse 3]\
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep\
And I planned it out for weeks now\
But it's finally sinkin' in\
Betty, right now is the last time\
I can dream about what happens when\
You see my face again\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
The only thing I wanna do\
Is make it up to you\
So I showed up at your party\
Yeah, I showed up at your party\
\
[Chorus]\
Yeah, I showed up at your party\
Will you have me? Will you love me?\
Will you kiss me on the porch\
In front of all your stupid friends?\
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?\
Will it patch your broken wings?\
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\
But I know I miss you\
\
[Outro]\
Standing in your cardigan\
Kissin' in my car again\

\
'Anti-Hero'\
\
\
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people\
I've ghosted stand there in the room\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I should not be left to my own devices\
They come with prices and vices\
I end up in crisis\
(Tale as old as time)\
I wake up screaming from dreaming\
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving\
'Cause you got tired of my scheming\
(For the last time)\
\
[Chorus]\
It's me, hi\
I'm the problem, it's me\
At teatime, everybody agrees\
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror\
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\
\
[Verse 2]\
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby\
And I'm a monster on the hill\
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city\
Pierced through the heart, but never killed\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism\
Like some kind of congressman?\
(A tale as old as time)\
I wake up screaming from dreaming\
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving\
And life will lose all its meaning\
(For the last time)\
\
[Chorus]\
It's me, hi\
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)\
At teatime, everybody agrees\
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror\
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero\
\
[Bridge]\
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money\
She thinks I left them in the will\
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out\
"She's laughing up at us from Hell"\
\
[Breakdown]\
It's me, hi\
I'm the problem, it's me\
It's me, hi\
I'm the problem, it's me\
It's me, hi\
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees\
[Chorus]\
It's me, hi (Hi)\
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)\
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)\

'Blank Space'\
\
\
Magic, madness, heaven, sin\
Saw you there and I thought\
"Oh, my God, look at that face\
You look like my next mistake\
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy\
New money, suit and tie\
I can read you like a magazine\
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly\
And I know you heard about me\
So, hey, let's be friends\
I'm dying to see how this one ends\
Grab your passport and my hand\
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend\
\
[Chorus]\
So it's gonna be forever\
Or it's gonna go down in flames?\
You can tell me when it's over, mm\
If the high was worth the pain\
Got a long list of ex-lovers\
They'll tell you I'm insane\
'Cause you know I love the players\
And you love the game\
'Cause we're young and we're reckless\
We'll take this way too far\
It'll leave you breathless, mm\
Or with a nasty scar\
Got a long list of ex-lovers\
They'll tell you I'm insane\
But I've got a blank space, baby\
And I'll write your name\
[Verse 2]\
Cherry lips, crystal skies\
I could show you incredible things\
Stolen kisses, pretty lies\
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen\
Find out what you want\
Be that girl for a month\
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no\
Screaming, crying, perfect storms\
I can make all the tables turn\
Rose garden filled with thorns\
Keep you second guessing, like\
"Oh, my God, who is she?"\
I get drunk on jealousy\
But you'll come back each time you leave\
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream\
\
[Chorus]\
So it's gonna be forever\
Or it's gonna go down in flames?\
You can tell me when it's over, mm\
If the high was worth the pain\
Got a long list of ex-lovers\
They'll tell you I'm insane\
'Cause you know I love the players\
And you love the game\
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)\
We'll take this way too far\
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm\
Or with a nasty scar\
Got a long list of ex-lovers\
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)\
But I've got a blank space, baby\
And I'll write your name\
[Bridge]\
Boys only want love if it's torture\
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya\
Boys only want love if it's torture\
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya\
\
[Chorus]\
So it's gonna be forever\
Or it's gonna go down in flames?\
You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm\
If the high was worth the pain\
Got a long list of ex-lovers\
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)\
'Cause you know I love the players\
And you love the game (And you love the game)\
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)\
We'll take this way too far (Ooh)\
It'll leave you breathless, mm\
Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)\
Got a long list of ex-lovers\
They'll tell you I'm insane\

'Style'\
\
\
A long drive\
Could end in burning flames or paradise\
Fade into view, oh\
It's been a while since I have even heard from you\
(Heard from you)\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I\
Know exactly where it leads, but I\
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time\
\
[Chorus]\
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye\
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like\
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time\
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style\
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt\
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt\
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time\
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style\
\
[Verse 2]\
So it goes\
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mmm\
Takes me home\
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mmm, yeah\
I say, "I heard, oh\
That you've been out and about with some other girl"\
Some other girl\
[Pre-Chorus]\
He says, "What you heard is true, but I\
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"\
I said, "I've been there too a few times"\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye\
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like\
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time\
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style\
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt\
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)\
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time\
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go), we never go out of style\
\
[Bridge]\
Take me home (Ah)\
Just take me home (Ah)\
Yeah, just take me home (Ah)\
Oh-oh, woah-oh, oh (Out of style)\
\
[Chorus]\
Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye\
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like\

'You\'92 re Losing Me (From The Vault)'\
\
\
Remember lookin' at this room? We loved it 'cause of the light\
Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?\
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix\
Always risin' from the ashes\
Mendin' all her gashes\
You might just have dealt the final blow\
\
[Chorus]\
Stop, you're losin' me\
Stop, you're losin' me\
Stop, you're losin' me\
I can't find a pulse\
My heart won't start anymore for you\
'Cause you're losin' me\
\
[Verse 2]\
Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes\
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?\
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick\
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And the air is thick with loss and indecision\
I know my pain is such an imposition\
Now, you're runnin' down the hallway\
And you know what they all say\
"You don't know what you got until it's gone"\
\
[Chorus]\
Stop, you're losin' me\
Stop, you're losin' me\
Stop, you're losin' me\
I can't find a pulse\
My heart won't start anymore for you\
'Cause you're losin' me\
'Cause you're losin' me\
Stop (Stop) 'cause you're losin' me\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
My heart won't start anymore\
(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)\
My heart won't start anymore\
(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)\
\
[Bridge]\
How long could we be a sad song\
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?\
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy\
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier\
Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me\
I'm the best thing at this party (You're losin' me)\
And I wouldn't marry me either\
A pathological people pleaser\
Who only wanted you to see her\
And I'm fadin', thinkin'\
"Do something, babe, say something" (Say something)\
"Lose something, babe, risk something" (You're losin' me)\
"Choose something, babe, I got nothing" (I got nothing)\
"To believe, unless you're choosin' me"\
[Outro]\
You're losin' me\
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me\
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me\

'\uc0\u8203 my tears ricochet'\
\
\
Even on my worst day,\uc0\u8197 did I deserve, babe\
All the hell you gave me?\
'Cause I\uc0\u8287 loved\u8287 you,\u8287 I swear I\u8287 loved you\
'Til my\uc0\u8287 dying day\
\
[Chorus]\
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace\
And you're the hero flying around, saving face\
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?\
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed\
Look at how my tears ricochet\
\
[Verse 2]\
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean\
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring\
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you\
But what a ghostly scene\
You wear the same jewels that I gave you\
As you bury me\
\
[Chorus]\
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace\
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave\
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?\
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed\
[Bridge]\
And I can go anywhere I want\
Anywhere I want, just not home\
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood\
But you would still miss me in your bones\
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)\
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)\
\
[Chorus]\
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace\
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves\
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same\
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed\
You turned into your worst fears\
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain\
Crossing out the good years\

'\'Slut!' (Taylor\'92s Version) [From The Vault]'\
\
\
Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool\
What if all I need is you?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Got love-struck, went straight to my head\
Got lovesick all over my bed\
Love to think you\'92ll never forget\
Handprints in wet cement\
Adorned with smoke on my clothes\
Lovelorn and nobody knows\
Love thorns all over this rose\
I'll pay the price, you won't\
\
[Chorus]\
But if I\'92m all dressed up\
They might as well be lookin' at us\
And if they call me a slut\
You know it might be worth it for once\
And if I'm gonna be drunk\
I might as well be drunk in love\
[Verse 2]\
Send the code, he's waitin' there\
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air\
Everyone wants him, that was my crime\
The wrong place at the right time\
And I break down, then he's pullin' me in\
In a world of boys, he's a gentleman\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Got love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)\
Got lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed)\
Love to think you\'92ll never forget\
We\'92ll pay the price, I guess\
\
[Chorus]\
But if I'm all dressed up (If I\'92m all dressed up)\
They might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us)\
And if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut)\
You know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once)\
And if I'm gonna be drunk\
I might as well be drunk in love\
\
[Bridge]\
Half asleep\
Takin\'92 your time in the tangerine\
Neon light, this is luxury\
You're not sayin' you're in love with me\
But you're goin' to\
Half awake\
Takin' your chance, it's a big mistake\
I said, "It might blow up in your pretty face"\
I'm not sayin', "Do it anyway" (Do it anyway)\
But you're going to\

(Up)\
And if they call me a (Slut)\
You know it might be worth it for once\

'...Ready for It?'\
\
\
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom\
Holdin' him for ransom, some\
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though\
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so\
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever\
Like a vendetta-ta\

[Pre-Chorus]\
I, I, I see how this is gon' go\
Touch me and you'll never be alone\

In the middle of the night, in my dreams\
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm\
In the middle of the night, in my dreams\
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time\
Are you ready for it?\
\
[Verse 2]\
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me\
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry\
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and\
We'll move to an island and\
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor\
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure\
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now\
Never be the same now, now\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I, I, I see how this is gon' go (Go)\
Touch me and you'll never be alone\
I-Island breeze and lights down low (Low)\
No one has to know (No one has to know)\

In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Yeah)\
You should see the things we do (We do), baby, mmm (Mmm)\

'You Need To Calm Down'\
\
\
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM\
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out\
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out\
And I'm just like, "Hey, are you okay?"\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression\
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun\
And snakes and stones never broke my bones\
\
[Chorus]\
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\
You need to calm down, you're being too loud\
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)\
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?\
You need to calm down\
\
[Verse 2]\
You are somebody that we don't know\
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile\
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)\
Sunshine on the street at the parade\
But you would rather be in the dark ages\
Makin' that sign must've taken all night\
[Pre-Chorus]\
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace\
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate\
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay\
\
[Chorus]\
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\
You need to calm down, you're being too loud\
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)\
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?\
You need to calm down\
\
[Bridge]\
And we see you over there on the internet\
Comparing all the girls who are killing it\
But we figured you out\
We all know now we all got crowns\
You need to calm down\
\
[Chorus]\
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh\
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)\
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)\
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)\
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)\

'\uc0\u8203 willow'\
\
\
And if it was an open-shut case\
I never would've known from that look on your face\
Lost in your current like a priceless wine\
\
[Chorus]\
The more that you say, the less I know\
Wherever you stray, I follow\
I'm begging for you to take my hand\
Wreck my plans, that's my man\
\
[Verse 2]\
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind\
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in\
As if you were a mythical thing\
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring\
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win\
\
[Chorus]\
The more that you say, the less I know\
Wherever you stray, I follow\
I'm begging for you to take my hand\
Wreck my plans, that's my man\
You know that my train could take you home\
Anywhere else is hollow\
I'm begging for you to take my hand\
Wreck my plans, that's my man\
[Bridge]\
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind\
They count me out time and time again\
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind\
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend\
\
[Verse 3]\
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark\
Show me the places where the others gave you scars\
Now this is an open-shut case\
I guess I should've known from the look on your face\
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art\
\
[Chorus]\
The more that you say, the less I know\
Wherever you stray, I follow\
I'm begging for you to take my hand\
Wreck my plans, that's my man\
You know that my train could take you home\
Anywhere else is hollow\
I'm begging for you to take my hand\
Wreck my plans, that's my man\
The more that you say, the less I know\
Wherever you stray, I follow\
I'm begging for you to take my hand\
Wreck my plans, that's my man\
You know that my train could take you home\
Anywhere else is hollow\
I'm begging for you to take my hand\
Wreck my plans, that's my man\
[Outro]\
Hey, that's my man\
That's my man\
Yeah, that's my man\
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art\
That's my man\
Hey, that's my man\

\
'You\'92re On Your Own, Kid'\
\
\
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me\
It's okay, we're the best of friends\
Anyway\
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys\
I touch my phone as if it's your face\
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out\
There's just one who could make me stay\
All my days\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes\
I waited ages to see you there\
I search the party of better bodies\
Just to learn that you never cared\
\
[Chorus]\
You're on your own, kid\
You always have been\
\
[Verse 2]\
I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May\
I picked the petals, he loves me not\
Something different bloomed, writing in my room\
I play my songs in the parking lot\
I'll run away\
[Pre-Chorus]\
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes\
I called a taxi to take me there\
I search the party of better bodies\
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare\
\
[Chorus]\
You're on your own, kid\
You always have been\
\
[Instrumental Break]\
\
[Bridge]\
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes\
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this\
I hosted parties and starved my body\
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss\
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money\
My friends from home don't know what to say\
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown\
And I saw something they can't take away\
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned\
Everything you lose is a step you take\
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it\
You've got no reason to be afraid\
[Chorus]\
You're on your own, kid\
Yeah, you can face this\
\

'\uc0\u8203 invisible string'\
\
\
I used\uc0\u8197 to\u8197 think I would\u8197 meet somebody there\
Teal was the color\uc0\u8197 of your shirt\
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop\
You\uc0\u8287 used\u8287 to\u8287 work at to\u8287 make a little\u8287 money\
\
[Chorus]\
Time, curious time\
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs\
Were there clues I didn't see?\
And isn't it just so pretty to think\
All along there was some\
Invisible string\
Tying you to me?\
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\
\
[Verse 2]\
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab\
On your first trip to LA\
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner\
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip\
Getting lunch down by the Lakes\
She said I looked like an American singer\
[Chorus]\
Time, mystical time\
Cutting me open, then healing me fine\
Were there clues I didn't see?\
And isn't it just so pretty to think\
All along there was some\
Invisible string\
Tying you to me?\
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\
\
[Bridge]\
A string that pulled me\
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar\
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire\
Chains around my demons\
Wool to brave the seasons\
One single thread of gold\
Tied me to you\
\
[Verse 3]\
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind\
For the boys who broke my heart\
Now I send their babies presents\
Gold was the color of the leaves\
When I showed you around Centennial Park\
Hell was the journey, but it brought me heaven\
[Chorus]\
Time, wondrous time\
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies\
And it's cool, baby, with me\
And isn't it just so pretty to think\
All along there was some\
Invisible string\
Tying you to me?\
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\
Me\
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\
\
[Outro]\
\
\
\
'We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together'\
\
\
We hadn't seen each other in a month\
When you said you needed space (What?)\
Then you come around again and say\
"Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me"\
Remember how that lasted for a day?\
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\
We called it off again last night, but\
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you\
\
[Chorus]\
We are never, ever, ever getting back together\
We are never, ever, ever getting back together\
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together\
Like, ever\
\
[Verse 2]\
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights\
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right\
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind\
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\
You called me up again tonight, but\
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh\
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you\
\
[Chorus]\
We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together\
We are never, ever, ever getting back together\
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)\
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)\
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)\
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)\
Oh-oh-oh\
\
[Bridge]\
I used to think that we were forever, ever\
And I used to say, "Never say never"\
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"\
And I'm like, "I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?\
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"\
\
[Chorus]\
(No) We are never, ever, ever getting back together\
We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together\
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me\
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together\
[Outro]\
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)\
Getting back together\
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh)\
Getting back together (Yeah)\
\
\
\
'Maroon'\
\
\
'Cause we lost track of time again\
Laughing with my feet in your lap\
Like you were my closest friend\
"How'd we end up\uc0\u8287 on\u8287 the\u8287 floor, anyway?" you\u8287 say\
"Your roommate's cheap-ass\uc0\u8287 screw-top ros\'e9, that's how"\
I see you every day now\
\
[Chorus]\
And I chose you\
The one I was dancing with\
In New York, no shoes\
Looked up at the sky and it was\
The burgundy on my t-shirt\
When you splashed your wine into me\
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks\
So scarlet, it was\
The mark th\uc0\u1077 y saw on my collarbone\
The rust that grew b\uc0\u1077 tween telephones\
The lips I used to call home\
So scarlet, it was maroon\
\
[Verse 2]\
When the silence came\
We were shaking, blind and hazy\
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?\
Sobbing with your head in your hands\
Ain't that the way shit always ends?\
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway\
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us\
I feel you, no matter what\
The rubies that I gave up\
[Chorus]\
And I lost you\
The one I was dancing with\
In New York, no shoes\
Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)\
The burgundy on my t-shirt\
When you splashed your wine into me\
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks\
So scarlet, it was (Maroon)\
The mark they saw on my collarbone\
The rust that grew between telephones\
The lips I used to call home\
So scarlet, it was maroon\
\
[Bridge]\
And I wake with your memory over me\
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)\
And I wake with your memory over me\
That's a real fucking legacy to leave\
\
[Chorus]\
The burgundy on my t-shirt\
When you splashed your wine into me\
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks\
So scarlet, it was maroon\
The mark they saw on my collarbone\
The rust that grew between telephones\
The lips I used to call home\
So scarlet, it was maroon\
[Outro]\
\
\
\
'All Too Well'\
\
\
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house\
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now\
\
[Verse 2]\
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze\
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate\
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place\
And I can picture it after all these days\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And I know it's long gone and\
That magic's not here no more\
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all\
Oh, oh, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause there we are again on that little town street\
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me\
Wind in my hair, I was there\
I remember it all too well\
\
[Verse 3]\
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red\
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed\
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team\
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And I know it's long gone and\
There was nothing else I could do\
And I forget about you long enough\
To forget why I needed to\
[Chorus]\
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night\
We're dancing \'91round the kitchen in the refrigerator light\
Down the stairs, I was there\
I remember it all too well, yeah\
\
[Bridge]\
Well, maybe we got lost in translation\
Maybe I asked for too much\
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece\
'Til you tore it all up\
Running scared, I was there\
I remember it all too well\
And you call me up again\
Just to break me like a promise\
So casually cruel in the name of being honest\
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\
'Cause I remember it all, all, all\
Too well\
[Verse 4]\
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it\
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it\
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own\
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone\
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week\
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me\
You can't get rid of it\
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so\
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known\
It was rare, I was there\
I remember it all too well\
\
[Outro]\
Wind in my hair, you were there\
You remember it all\
Down the stairs, you were there\
You remember it all\
\
\
\
'\uc0\u8203 seven'\
\
\
Feet in the swing over\uc0\u8197 the\u8197 creek\
I was too\uc0\u8197 scared to jump in\
But I, I\uc0\u8197 was high in the sky\
With Pennsylvania under me\
Are there still beautiful things?\
\
[Chorus]\
Sweet tea in the summer\
Cross your heart, won't tell no other\
And though I can\'92t recall your face\
I still got love for you\
Your braids like a pattern\
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn\
Passed down like folk songs\
The love lasts so long\
\
[Bridge]\
And I've been meaning to tell you\
I think your house is haunted\
Your dad is always mad and that must be why\
And I think you should come live with me\
And we can be pirates\
Then you won't have to cry\
Or hide in the closet\
And just like a folk song\
Our love will be passed on\
[Verse 2]\
Please picture me in the weeds\
Before I learned civility\
I used to scream ferociously\
Any time I wanted\
I, I\
\
[Chorus]\
Sweet tea in the summer\
Cross my heart, won\'92t tell no other\
And though I can't recall your face\
I still got love for you\
Pack your dolls and a sweater\
We'll move to India forever\
\
\
\
'Love Story'\
\
\
I'm standing there\
On a balcony in summer air\
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns\
See you make your way through the crowd\
And say, "Hello"\
Little did I know\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles\
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"\
And I was crying on the staircase\
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said\
\
[Chorus]\
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run\
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"\
\
[Verse 2]\
So I sneak out to the garden to see you\
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew\
So close your eyes\
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh\
[Pre-Chorus]\
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter\
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"\
But you were everything to me\
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said\
\
[Chorus]\
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone\
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run\
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess\
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"\
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel\
This love is difficult, but it's real\
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess\
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Oh, oh\
\
[Bridge]\
But I got tired of waiting\
Wondering if you were ever coming around\
My faith in you was fading\
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said\
\
[Chorus]\
"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone\
I keep waiting for you, but you never come\
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"\
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said\
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\
I love you and that's all I really know\
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'"\
[Outro]\
Oh, oh, oh\

'\uc0\u8203 the last great american dynasty'\
\
\
Bill was the heir to\uc0\u8197 the Standard Oil name and money\
And the town said, "How\uc0\u8287 did\u8287 a\u8287 middle-class divorc\'e9e do\u8287 it?"\
The wedding was\uc0\u8287 charming, if a little gauche\
There's only so far new money goes\
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"\
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud\
The doctor had told him to settle down\
It must have been her fault his heart gave out\
\
[Chorus]\
And they said\
"There goes the last great American dynasty\
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been\
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen\
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"\
\
[Verse 2]\
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever\
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city\
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names\
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet\
And losing on card game bets with Dal\'ed\
[Chorus]\
And they said\
"There goes the last great American dynasty\
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been\
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen\
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"\
\
[Bridge]\
They say she was seen on occasion\
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea\
And in a feud with her neighbor\
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green\
Fifty years is a long time\
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach\
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits\
And then it was bought by me\
\
[Chorus]\
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been\
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen\
I had a marvelous time ruining everything\
\
[Outro]\
I had a marvelous time ruining everything\
A marvelous time ruining everything\
\
\
\
'Now That We Don\'92t Talk (Taylor\'92s Version) [From The Vault]'\
\
\
You part the crowd like the Red Sea\
Don't even get me started\
Did you get anxious though\
On the way home?\
I guess I'll never, ever know\
Now that we don't talk\
\
[Verse 2]\
You grew your hair long\
You got new icons\
And from the outside\
It looks like you're tryin' lives on\
I miss the old ways\
You didn't have to change\
But I guess I don't have a say\
Now that we don't talk\
\
[Chorus]\
I call my mom, she said that it was for the best\
Remind myself, the mor\uc0\u1077  I gave, you'd want me less\
I cannot b\uc0\u1077  your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost\
And what it cost, now that we don't talk\
[Bridge]\
What do you tell your friends we\
Shared dinners, long weekends with?\
Truth is, I can't pretend it's\
Platonic, it's just ended, so\
\
[Chorus]\
I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)\
Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left (Until I left)\
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (Of what I lost)\
And what it cost, now that we don't talk\
\
[Outro]\
I don't have to pretend I like acid rock\
Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht\
With important men who think important thoughts\
Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk\
And the only way back to my dignity\
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery\
\
\
\
'Karma'\
\
\
You're terrified to look down\
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare\
Of everyone you burned just to get there\
It's coming back around\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And I keep my side of the street clean\
You wouldn't know what I mean\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause karma is my boyfriend\
Karma is a god\
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend\
Karma's a relaxing thought\
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?\
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat\
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me\
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat\
Me and karma vibe like that\
\
[Verse 2]\
Spiderboy, king of thieves\
Weave your little webs of opacity\
My pennies made your crown\
Trick me once, trick me twice\
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?\
It's coming back around\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And I keep my side of the street clean\
You wouldn't know what I mean\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause karma is my boyfriend\
Karma is a god\
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend\
Karma's a relaxing thought\
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?\
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat\
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me\
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat\
Me and karma vibe like that\
\
[Bridge]\
Ask me what I learned from all those years\
Ask me what I earned from all those tears\
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here\
(I'm still here, I'm still here)\
\
[Breakdown]\
'Cause karma is the thunder\
Rattling your ground\
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter\
Karma's gonna track you down\
Step by step, from town to town\
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen\
Karma takes all my friends to the summit\
Karma is the guy on the screen\
Coming straight home to me\
[Chorus]\
'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)\
Karma is a god\
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)\
Karma's a relaxing thought\
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?\
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat\
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me\
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat\
Me and karma vibe like that\
\
[Outro]\
Karma is my boyfriend\
Karma is a god (Ah)\

'\uc0\u8203 happiness'\
\
\
But now I'm right\uc0\u8197 down\u8197 in it, all\u8197 the years I've given\
Is just shit\uc0\u8197 we're dividin' up\
Showed you all of my hiding spots\
I was dancing when the music stopped\
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention\
I haven't met the new me yet\
\
[Chorus]\
There'll be happiness after you\
But there was happiness because of you\
Both of these things can be true\
There is happiness\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Past the blood and bruise\
Past the curses and cries\
Beyond the terror in the nightfall\
Haunted by the look in my eyes\
That would've loved you for a lifetime\
Leave it all behind\
And there is happiness\
\
[Verse 2]\
Tell me, when did your winning smile\
Begin to look like a smirk?\
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons\
Pointed at my deepest hurt?\
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool\
Who takes my spot next to you\
No, I didn't mean that\
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury\
[Chorus]\
There'll be happiness after me\
But there was happiness because of me\
Both of these things, I believe\
There is happiness\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
In our history, across our great divide\
There is a glorious sunrise\
Dappled with the flickers of light\
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind\
And there is happiness\
\
[Bridge]\
I can't make it go away by making you a villain\
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven\
And I pulled your body into mine\
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties\
No one teaches you what to do\
When a good man hurts you\
And you know you hurt him too\
\
[Verse 3]\
Honey, when I'm above the trees\
I see it for what it is\
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head\
After giving you the best I had\
Tell me what to give after that\
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness\
You haven't met the new me yet\
And I think she'll give you that\
[Chorus]\
There'll be happiness after you\
But there was happiness because of you too\
Both of these things can be true\
There is happiness\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
In our history, across our great divide\
There is a glorious sunrise\
Dappled with the flickers of light\
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind\
Oh, leave it all behind\

\
'\uc0\u8203 this is me trying'\
\
\
I didn't\uc0\u8197 know\u8197 if you'd care\u8197 if I came back\
I have a\uc0\u8197 lot of regrets about that\
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout\
Could've followed my fears all the way down\
And maybe I don't quite know what to say\
But I'm here in your doorway\
\
[Chorus]\
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying\
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying\
[Verse 2]\
They told me all of my cages were mental\
So I got wasted like all my potential\
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad\
I have a lot of regrets about that\
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere\
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here\
Pouring out my heart to a stranger\
But I didn't pour the whiskey\
\
[Chorus]\
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying\
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying\
[Post-Chorus]\
At least I'm trying\
\
[Bridge]\
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound\
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you\
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town\
\
[Chorus]\
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying\
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)\
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying\

'\uc0\u8203 illicit affairs'\
\
\
Tell your friends\uc0\u8197 you're\u8197 out for a\u8197 run\
You\'92ll be flushed when you return\
Take\uc0\u8197 the road less traveled by\
Tell yourself you can always stop\
What started in beautiful rooms\
Ends with meetings in parking lots\
\
[Chorus]\
And that's the thing about illicit affairs\
And clandestine meetings and longing stares\
It's born from just one single glance\
But it dies and it dies and it dies\
A million little times\
\
[Verse 2]\
Leave the perfume on the shelf\
That you picked out just for him\
So you leave no trace behind\
Like you don\'92t even exist\
Take the words for what they are\
A dwindling, mercurial high\
A drug that only worked\
The first few hundred times\
[Chorus]\
And that's the thing about illicit affairs\
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares\
They show their truth one single time\
But they lie and they lie and they lie\
A million little times\
\
[Bridge]\
And you wanna scream\
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"\
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me\
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else\
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"\
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me\
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else\
\
[Outro]\
And you know damn well\
\
\
\
'Delicate'\
\
\
You must like me for me\
We can't make\
Any promises now, can we, babe?\
But you can make me a drink\
[Verse 1]\
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?\
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black\
Come here, you can meet me in the back\
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you\
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue\
Just think of the fun things we could do\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best\
My reputation's never been worse, so\
You must like me for me\
(Yeah, I want you) We can't make\
Any promises now, can we, babe?\
But you can make me a drink\
\
[Chorus]\
Is it cool that I said all that?\
Is it chill that you're in my head?\
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)\
Is it cool that I said all that?\
Is it too soon to do this yet?\
'Cause I know that it's delicate\
[Post-Chorus]\
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?\
\
[Verse 2]\
Third floor on the West Side, me and you\
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view\
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?\
Long night with your hands up in my hair\
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs\
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best\
My reputation's never been worse, so\
You must like me for me\
(Yeah, I want you) We can't make\

Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?\
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?\
\
[Bridge]\
Sometimes, I wonder, when you sleep\
Are you ever dreaming of me?\
Sometimes, when I look into your eyes\
I pretend you're mine all the damn time\
\
[Chorus]\
('Cause I like you)\
Is it cool that I said all that?\
Is it chill that you're in my head?\
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)\
(Yeah, I want you)\
Is it cool that I said all that?\
Is it too soon to do this yet?\
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)\

'Cause I know that it's delicate (Isn't it delicate?)\
(Yeah, I want you)\
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)\
Is it too soon to do this yet? (Isn't it? Isn't it?)\

'Call It What You Want'\
\
\
They took the crown, but it's alright\
All the liars are calling me one\
Nobody's heard from me for months\
I'm doin' better than I ever was\
'Cause\
\
[Chorus]\
My baby's fit like a daydream\
Walkin' with his head down\
I'm the one he's walking to\
So call it what you want, yeah\
Call it what you want to\
My baby's fly like a jet stream\
High above the whole scene\
Loves me like I'm brand new\
So call it what you want, yeah\
Call it what you want to\
\
[Verse 2]\
All my flowers grew back as thorns\
Windows boarded up after the storm\
He built a fire just to keep me warm\
All the drama queens taking swings\
All the jokers dressing up as kings\
They fade to nothing when I look at him\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And I know I make the same mistakes every time\
Bridges burn, I never learn\
At least I did one thing right\
I did one thing right\
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers\
Trust him like a brother\
Yeah, you know I did one thing right\
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night\
\
[Chorus]\
My baby's fit like a daydream\
Walkin' with his head down\
I'm the one he's walking to\
So call it what you want, yeah\
Call it what you want to\
My baby's fly like a jet stream\
High above the whole scene\
Loves me like I'm brand new\
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)\
So call it what you want, yeah\
Call it what you want to\
\
[Bridge]\
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck\
Chain 'round my neck\
Not because he owns me\
But 'cause he really knows me\
Which is more than they can say, I\
I recall late November\
Holding my breath, slowly, I said\
"You don't need to save me\
But would you run away with me?"\
Yes (Would you run away?)\
[Chorus]\
My baby's fit like a daydream\
Walkin' with his head down\
I'm the one he's walking to\
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)\
So call it what you want, yeah (Call it what you want it to)\
Call it what you want to\
My baby's fly like a jet stream (Oh)\
High above the whole scene\
Loves me like I'm brand new\
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)\
So call it what you want, yeah\
Call it what you want to\

'Question...?'\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
Good girl, sad boy\
Big city, wrong choices\
We had one thing goin' on\
I swear that\uc0\u8197 it\u8197 was somethin'\
'Cause I\uc0\u8197 don't remember who I was\
Before you\uc0\u8197 painted all my nights\
A color I've searched for since\
But one thing after another\
Fuckin' situations, circumstances\
Miscommunications, and I\
Have to say, by the way\
I just may like some explanations\
\
[Chorus]\
Can I ask you a question?\
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room\
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you\
But fifteen seconds later, th\uc0\u1077 y were clappin' too?\
Then what did you do?\
Did you l\uc0\u1077 ave her house in the middle of the night? Oh\
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh\
When she said it was too much?\
Do you wish you could still touch her?\
It's just a question\
[Verse 2]\
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise\
Did you realize out of time?\
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy\
That you saw that night\
But you were on somethin'\
It was one drink after another\
Fuckin' politics and gender roles\
And you're not sure and I don't know\
Got swept away in the gray\
I just may like to have a conversation\
\
[Chorus]\
Can I ask you a question?\
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room\
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you\
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?\
Then what did you do?\
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh\
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh\
When she said it was too much?\
Do you wish you could still touch her?\
It's just a question\
\
[Bridge]\
Does it feel like everything's just like\
Second best after that meteor strike?\
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?\
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable\
And right, but tonight\
[Chorus]\
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)\
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)\
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you (Makin' fun of you)\
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?\
Then what did you do? (Do)\
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh\
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh (More of a fight)\
When she said it was too much?\

Fading into madness\
Oh no, oh no, it won't stop\

I hold my breath a little bit longer\
Halfway out the door, but it won't close\

I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"\

Strike a match, then you blow it out\

And I'm yours, but you're not mine\
Oh no, oh no, you're not there\

'\uc0\u8203 ivy'\
\
\
In a faith-forgotten land\
In from the snow\
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow\
Tarnished but so grand\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And the old widow goes to the stone every day\
But I don't, I just sit here and wait\
Grieving for the living\
\
[Chorus]\
Oh, goddamn\
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand\
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another\
Oh, I can't\
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland\
My house of stone, your ivy grows\
And now I'm covered in you\
\
[Verse 2]\
I wish to know\
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be\
Magnificently cursed\
He's in the room\
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see\
He wants what's only yours\
[Chorus]\
Oh, goddamn\
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand\
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another\
Oh, I can't\
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland\
My house of stone, your ivy grows\
And now I'm covered\
\
[Verse 3]\
Clover blooms in the fields\
Spring breaks loose, the time is near\
What would he do if he found us out?\
Crescent moon, coast is clear\
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear\
He's gonna burn this house to the ground\
How's one to know?\
I'd live and die for moments that we stole\
On begged and borrowed time\
So tell me to run\
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become\
And drink my husband's wine\
\
[Chorus]\
Oh, goddamn\
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand\
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another\
Oh, I can't\
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland\
My house of stone, your ivy grows\
And now I'm covered in you\
And I'm covered in you\
[Bridge]\
So yeah, it's a fire\
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark\
And you started it\
You started it\
So yeah, it's a war\
It's the goddamn fight of my life\
And you started it\
You started it\
\

Oh, I can't\
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland\
My house of stone, your ivy grows\

In you, in you\

'Mastermind'\
\
\
You and I ended up in the same room\
At the same time\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse\
Of a chain reaction of countermoves\
To assess the equation of you\
Checkmate, I couldn't lose\
\
[Chorus]\
What if I told you none of it was accidental?\
And the first night that you saw me\
Nothing was gonna stop me\
I laid the groundwork, and then\
Just like clockwork\
The dominoes cascaded in a line\
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?\
And now you're mine\
It was all by d\uc0\u1077 sign\
'Cause I'm a mastermind\
\
[Verse 2]\
You see, all the wis\uc0\u1077 st women\
Had to do it this way\
'Cause we were born to be the pawn\
In every lover's game\
[Pre-Chorus]\
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail\
Strategy sets the scene for the tale\
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails\
And the liquor in our cocktails\
\
[Chorus]\
What if I told you none of it was accidental?\
And the first night that you saw me\
I knew I wanted your body\
I laid the groundwork, and then\
Just like clockwork\
The dominoes cascaded in a line\
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?\
And now you're mine\
It was all my design\
'Cause I'm a mastermind\
[Bridge]\
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid\
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since\
To make them love me and make it seem effortless\
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess\
And I swear\
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian\
'Cause I care\
[Chorus]\
So I told you none of it was accidental\
And the first night that you saw me\
Nothing was gonna stop me\
I laid the groundwork, and then\
Saw a wide smirk on your face\
You knew the entire time\
You knew that I'm a mastermind\
And now you're mine\

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend\
She's like, "Oh my God," but I'm just gonna shake\

Won't you come on over, baby?\

'Hits Different'\
\
\
I pictured you with other girls in love\
Then threw up on the street\
Like waiting for a bus that never shows\
You just start walkin' on\
They say that if it's right, you know\
Each bar plays our song\
Nothing has ever felt so wrong\
\
[Chorus]\
Oh, my, love is a lie\
Shit my friends say to get me by\
It hits different\
It hits different this time\
Catastrophic blues\
Movin' on was always easy for me to do\
It hits different\
It hits different 'cause it's you\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
('Cause it's you)\
\
[Verse 2]\
I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost\
Rip the band-aid off and skip town lik\uc0\u1077  an asshole outlaw\
Freedom felt like summ\uc0\u1077 r then on the coast\
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings\
And I never don't cry (And I never don't cry) at the bar\
Yeah, my sadness is contagious (My sadness is contagious)\
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car\
I stopped receiving invitations\
[Chorus]\
Oh, my, love is a lie\
Shit my friends say to get me by\
It hits different\
It hits different this time\
Catastrophic blues\
Movin' on was always easy for me to do\
It hits different\
It hits different 'cause it's you\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
('Cause it's you)\
\
[Bridge]\
I find the artifacts, cried over a hat\
Cursed the space that I needed\
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense\
Why the wound is still bleedin'\
You were the one that I loved\
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough\
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes\
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy\
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief\
In the good in the world, you once believed in me\
And I felt you and I held you for a while\
Bet I could still melt your world\
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl\
[Verse 3]\
I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway\
Is that your key in the door?\
Is it okay? Is it you?\
Or have they come to take me away?\
To take me away\
\
[Chorus]\
Oh, my, love is a lie\
Shit my friends say to get me by\
It hits different (It hits different)\
It hits different this time\
Catastrophic blues\
Movin' on was always easy for me to do\
It hits different (It hits different)\
It hits different 'cause it's you\

Shimmering beautiful\

Hush, when no one is around, my dear\
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes\
Spinning in my highest heels, love\
Shining just for you\
Hush, I know they said the end is near\
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes\
Spinning in my highest heels, love\
Shining just for you\
\
[Verse 2]\
I want you to know\
I'm a mirrorball\
I can change everything about me to fit in\
You are not like the regulars\
The masquerade revelers\
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten\
[Chorus]\
Hush, when no one is around, my dear\
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes\
Spinning in my highest heels, love\
Shining just for you\
Hush, I know they said the end is near\
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes\
Spinning in my highest heels, love\
Shining just for you\

[Bridge]\
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down\
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns\
I'm still on that tightrope\
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me\
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why\
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try\
I'm still on that trapeze\
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me\

If you tasted poison,\uc0\u8197 you\u8197 could've\
Spit me out\uc0\u8197 at the first chance\
And if I\uc0\u8197 was some paint, did it splatter\
On a promising grown man?\
And if I was a child, did it matter\
If you got to wash your hands?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Ooh, all I used to do was pray\
Would've, could've, should've\
If you'd never looked my way\
\
[Chorus]\
I would've stayed on my knees\
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil\
At nineteen\
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven\
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts\
Memories feel like weapons\
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering\
\
[Verse 2]\
If you never touched me, I would've\
Gone along with the righteous\
If I never blushed, then they could've\
Never whispered about this\
And if you never saved me from boredom\
I could've gone on as I was\
But, Lord, you made me feel important\
And then you tried to erase us\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith\
Would've, could've, should've\
If I'd only played it safe\
\
[Chorus]\
I would've stayed on my knees\
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil\
At nineteen\
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven\
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts\
Memories feel like weapons\
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering\
\
[Bridge]\
God rest my soul\
I miss who I used to be\
The tomb won't close\
Stained glass windows in my mind\
I regret you all the time\
I can't let this go\
I fight with you in my sleep\
The wound won't close\
I keep on waiting for a sign\
I regret you all the time\
[Verse 3]\
If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?\
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I\
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts\
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first\
\
[Chorus]\
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil\
At nineteen\
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven\
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts\
Memories feel like weapons\
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering\
\
[Outro]\
God rest my soul\
I miss who I used to be\

The wound won't close\
I keep on waiting for a sign\
I regret you all the time\
Oh, God rest my soul\
I miss who I used to be\
The tomb won't close\
Stained glass windows in my mind\

I fight with you in my sleep\
The wound won't close\

I struck a match and blew your mind\
But I didn\'92t mean it and you didn't see it\
The ties were black, the lies were white\
In shades of gray in candlelight\
I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart\
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself\
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed\
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh)\
\
[Chorus]\
You were drivin\'92 the getaway car\
We were flyin', but we'd never get far\
Don't pretend it's such a mystery\
Think about the place where you first met me\
Ridin' in a getaway car\
There were sirens in the beat of your heart\
Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave\
Think about the place where you first met me\
[Post-Chorus]\
In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)\
No, they never get far (Oh-oh-ah)\
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car\
\
[Verse 2]\
It was the great escape, the prison break\
The light of freedom on my face\
But you weren\'92t thinkin\'92 and I was just drinkin'\
While he was runnin\'92 after us, I was screamin', "Go, go, go"\
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow\
And a circus ain't a love story and now we\'92re both sorry (We're both sorry)\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
"X" marks the spot where we fell apart\
He poisoned the well, every man for himself\
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed\
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh)\
\
[Chorus]\
You were drivin' the getaway car\
We were flyin', but we'd never get far\
Don't pretend it's such a mystery\
Think about the place where you first met me\
Ridin' in a getaway car\
There were sirens in the beat of your heart\
Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave\
Think about the place where you first met me\
[Post-Chorus]\
In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)\
No, they never get far (Oh-oh-ah)\
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car\
\
[Bridge]\
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)\
Until I switched to the other side, to the other side\
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)\
'Cause us traitors never win\
\
[Breakdown]\
I'm in a getaway car\
I left you in a motel bar\
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys\
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh)\
\
[Chorus]\
Drivin' the getaway car\
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)\
Don't pretend it's such a mystery\
Think about the place where you first met me\
Ridin' in a getaway car\
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Shoulda known)\
Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave\
Think about the place where you first met me\
[Post-Chorus]\
In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)\
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ah\
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car\
\
[Outro]\
I was ridin' in a getaway car\
I was cryin' in a getaway car\
I was dyin' in a getaway car\
Said goodbye in a getaway car\
Ridin' in a getaway car\
I was cryin' in a getaway car\
\

\
'\uc0\u8203 peace'\
\
\
I never had the courage of\uc0\u8197 my\u8197 convictions\
As long as\uc0\u8197 danger is near\
And it's just around\uc0\u8197 the corner, darlin'\
'Cause it lives in me\
No, I could never\uc0\u8287 give\u8287 you\u8287 peace\
\
[Chorus]\
But I'm a\uc0\u8287 fire and I'll\u8287 keep your brittle heart warm\
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come\
All these people think love's for show\
But I would die for you in secret\
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me\
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?\
\
[Verse 2]\
Your integrity makes me seem small\
You paint dreamscapes on the wall\
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor\
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences\
Sit with you in the trenches\
Give you my wild, give you a child\
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other\
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother\
Is it enough?\
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west\
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best\
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me\
[Chorus]\
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm\
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come\
All these people think love's for show\
But I would die for you in secret\
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me\
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?\

'Gorgeous'\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
You should take it as a compliment\
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk\
You should think about the consequence\
Of your magnetic field bein' a little too strong\
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us\
He's in the club doin' I don't know what\
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine\
You've ruined my life by not bein' mine\
\
[Chorus]\
You're so gorgeous\
I can't say anything to your face\
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)\
And I'm so furious\
At you for makin' me feel this way\
But what can I say? You're gorgeous\
\
[Verse 2]\
You should take it as a compliment\
That I'm talkin' to everyone here but you (But you, but you)\
And you should think about the consequence\
Of you touchin' my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)\
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her\
But if you're single, that's honestly worse\
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Ocean blue eyes lookin' in mine\
I feel like I might sink and drown and die\
\
[Chorus]\
You're so gorgeous\
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)\
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face; Gorgeous)\
And I'm so furious\
At you for makin' me feel this way (Feel this way)\
But what can I say? You're gorgeous\
\
[Bridge]\
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)\
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)\
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)\
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)\
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)\
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Ugh) alone\
Unless you wanna come along (Oh)\
\
[Chorus]\
You're so gorgeous (Gorgeous)\
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)\
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face; Gorgeous)\
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)\
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)\
But what can I say? (I say) You're gorgeous\
[Outro]\
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)\
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)\
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)\
You're gorgeous\
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Turns back to sad)\
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (What I can't have)\

'Midnight Rain'\
\
\
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name\
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same\
All of me changed like midnight\
\
[Verse 1]\
My town was a wasteland\
Full of cages, full of fences\
Pageant queens and big pretenders\
But for some, it was paradise\
My boy was a montage\
A slow-motion, love potion\
Jumping off things in the ocean\
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice\
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain\
\
[Chorus]\
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain\
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name\
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same\
All of me changed like midnight\
\
[Verse 2]\
It came like a postcard\
Picture perfect shiny family\
Holiday peppermint candy\
But for him, it's every day\
So I peered through a window\
A deep portal, time travel\
All the love we unravel\
And the life I gave away\
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain\
[Chorus]\
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain\
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name\
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same\
All of me changed like midnight rain\
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain\
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name\
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same\
All of me changed like midnight\
\
[Outro]\
I guess sometimes we all get\
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted\
And he never thinks of me\
Except for when I'm on TV\
I guess sometimes we all get\
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted\
And I never think of him\
\
\
\
'Vigilante Shit'\
\
\
Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie\
They say looks can kill and I might try\
I don't dress for women\
I don't dress for men\
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge\
\
[Chorus]\
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends\
Don't get sad, get even\
So on the weekends\
I don't dress for friends\
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge\
\
[Verse 2]\
She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some\
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?\
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride\
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife\
And she looks so pretty\
Drivin' in your Benz\
Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge\
\
[Chorus]\
She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends\
Don't get sad, get even\
So on the weekends\
She don't dress for friends\
Lately, she's been dressing for revenge\
[Bridge]\
Ladies always rise above\
Ladies know what people want\
Someone sweet and kind and fun\
The lady simply had enough\
\
[Verse 3]\
While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine\
Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI\
And I don't dress for villains\
Or for innocents\
I'm on my vigilante shit again\
\
[Chorus]\
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends\
Don't get sad, get even\
So on the weekends\

'\uc0\u8203 gold rush'\
\
\
Ships on waters\
So inviting, I almost jump in\
\
[Chorus]\
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush\
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush\
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch\
Everybody wants you\
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you\
Walk past, quick brush\
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush\
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush\
Everybody wants you\
But I don't like a gold rush\
\
[Verse 1]\
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?\
With your hair falling into place like dominoes\
I see me padding across your wooden floors\
With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door\
\
[Refrain]\
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit\
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had n\uc0\u1077 ver seen a love as pure as it\
And th\uc0\u1077 n it fades into the gray of my day-old tea\
'Cause it could never be\
[Chorus]\
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush\
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush\
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch\
Everybody wants you\
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you\
Walk past, quick brush\
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush\
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush\
Everybody wants you\
But I don't like a gold rush\
\
[Verse 2]\
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?\
With your hair falling into place like dominoes\
My mind turns your life into folklore\
I can't dare to dream about you anymore\
\
[Refrain]\
At dinner parties, I won't call you out on your contrarian shit\
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it\
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea\
'Cause it will never be\

'What About Us'\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
We are searchlights, we can see in the dark\
We are rockets, pointed up at the stars\
We are billions of beautiful hearts\
And you sold us down the river too far\
\
[Chorus]\
What about us?\
What about all the times you said you had the answers?\
What about us?\
What about all the broken happy ever afters?\
What about us?\
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?\
What about love? What about trust?\
What about us?\
\
[Verse 2]\
We are problems that want to be solved\
We are children that need to be loved\
We were willin', we came when you called\
But man, you fooled us\
Enough is enough, oh\
[Chorus]\
What about us?\
What about all the times you said you had the answers?\
What about us?\
What about all the broken happy ever afters?\
Oh, what about us?\
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?\
Oh, what about love? What about trust?\
What about us?\

Oh, what about us?\
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?\
What about love? What about trust?\
What about us?\

[Bridge]\
Sticks and stones, they may break these bones\
But then, I'll be ready, are you ready?\
It's the start of us, waking up, come on\
Are you ready? I'll be ready\
I don't want control, I want to let go\
Are you ready? I'll be ready\
'Cause now it's time to let them know\
We are ready, what about us?\
[Chorus]\
What about us?\
What about all the times you said you had the answers?\
So, what about us?\
What about all the broken happy ever afters?\
Oh, what about us?\
What about all the plans that ended in disaster?\
Oh, what about love? What about trust?\

'Beautiful Trauma'\
\
\
It's like we burn so bright, we burn out\
I made you chase me\
I wasn't that friendly\
My love, my drug, we're fucked up, oh\
\
[Pre-Chorus 1]\
'Cause I've been on the run so long they can't find me\
You're waking up to remember I'm pretty\
And when the chemicals leave my body\
Yeah, they're gonna find me in a hotel lobby 'cause\
Mmm, tough\
Times they keep comin'\
All night\
Laughin' and fuckin'\
Some days like I'm barely breathin'\
After we were high and the love dope died it was you\
\
[Chorus]\
The pill I keep takin'\
The nightmare I wake in\
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you\
My perfect rock bottom\
My beautiful trauma\
My love, my love, my drug, oh\
[Post-Chorus]\
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh\
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh\
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh\
My love, (Oh) my love, my drug, we're fucked up\
\
[Verse 2]\
You punched a hole in\
The wall and I framed it\
I wish I could feel things like you\
Everyone's chasing\
That holy feeling\
And if we don't stay lit we'll blow out\
Blow out\
\
[Pre-Chorus 2]\
'Cause we've been on the run so long they can't find us\
Who's gonna have to die to remind us\
That it feels like we chose this blindly\
Now I'm gonna fuck up a hotel lobby\
'Cause these tough\
Times they keep comin'\
Last night\
I might have messed it up again\
Some days like I'm barely breathin'\
But after we were high and the love dope died it was you\
[Chorus]\
The pill I keep takin'\
The nightmare I wake in\
There's nothin', no nothin', nothin' but you\
My perfect rock bottom\
My beautiful trauma\
My love, my love, my drug, oh\

'Try'\
\
\
Sometimes I think\uc0\u65279  that it's better\
To never ask why\
\
[Chorus]\
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame\
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned\
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die\
You've gotta get up and try, try, try\
Gotta get up and try, try, try\
You gotta get up and try, try, try\
\
[Bridge]\
Eh, eh, eh\
\
[Verse 2]\
Funny how the heart can be deceiving\
More than just a couple times\
Why do we fall in love so easy?\
Even when it's not right\
\
[Chorus]\
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame\
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned\
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die\
You've gotta get up and try, try, try\
Gotta get up and try, try, try\
You gotta get up and try, try, try\
[Verse 3]\
Ever worried that it might be ruined\
And does it make you wanna cry?\
When you're out there doing what you're doing\
Are you just getting by?\
Tell me, are you just getting by, by, by?\
\
[Chorus]\
Where there is desire, there is gonna be a flame\
Where there is a flame, someone's bound to get burned\
But just because it burns doesn't mean you're gonna die\
You've gotta get up and try, try, try\
Gotta get up and try, try, try\
You gotta get up and try, try, try\
Gotta get up and try, try, try\

We came here to run it, run it, run it\
We came here to run it, run it, run it\

Just like fire, burnin' up the way\
If I could light the world up for just one day\
Watch this madness, colorful charade\
No one can be just like me any way\
Just like magic, I'll be flyin' free\
I'mma disappear when they come for me\
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?\
No one can be just like me anyway\
Just like fire, uh\
\
[Verse 2]\
And people like to laugh at you cause they are all the same, mmm\
See I would rather we just go a different way than play the game\
And no matter the weather, we can do it better\
You and me together, forever and ever\
We don't have to worry 'bout a thing, 'bout a thing\

We came here to run it, run it, run it\

Just like fire, fire, fire\
Run it, run it, run it\
We came here to run it, run it, run it\

[Verse 3]\
So look, I came here to run it\
Just cause nobody's done it\
Y'all don't think I can run it\
But look, I been here, I done it\
Impossible? Please\
Watch, I do it with ease\
You just gotta believe\
Come uh, come uh with me\
Oh, what's a girl to do? (What, what?)\
Hey, what's a girl to do? (What, what?)\
Oh, what's a girl to do? (What, what?)\
Mmmm, what's a girl to do?\

I guess I just lost my husband\
I don't know where he went\
So I'm gonna drink my money\
I'm not gonna pay his rent (Nope)\
I got a brand new attitude\
And I'm gonna wear it tonight\
I wanna get in trouble\
I wanna start a fight\

The waiter just took my table\
And gave it to Jessica Simp\'97 (Shit)\
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy\
At least he'll know how to hit (Oops)\
What if this song's on the radio?\
Then somebody's gonna die\
I'm gonna get in trouble\
My ex'll start a fight\
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na, he's gonna start a fight (Huh)\

If someone said three years from now\
You'd be long gone\
I'd stand up and punch them out\
'Cause they're all wrong\
I know better 'cause you said forever\
And ever, who knew?\

Remember when we were such fools\
And so convinced and just too cool?\
Oh no, no, no\
I wish I could touch you again\
I wish I could still call you, friend\
I'd give anything\

I was all wrong\
They knew better, still, you said forever\
And ever, who knew?\

Walk me home in the dead of night\
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm\
So say you'll stay with me tonight\
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside\
\
[Verse 2]\
There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry\
That makes me think we'll make it out alive\
So come on and show me how we're good\
I think that we could do some good, mhm\
\
[Chorus]\
Walk me home in the dead of night\
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm\

'Fuckin\'92 Perfect'\
\
\
Bad decisions, that's alright\
Welcome to my silly life\
\
[Pre-Chorus 1]\
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood\
Miss "Knowing it's all good\'94 it didn't slow me down\
Mistaken, always second guessing\
Underestimated, look, I'm still around\
\
[Chorus]\
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel\
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect\
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel\
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me\
\
[Verse 2]\
You're so mean (You're so mean) when you talk (When you talk)\
About yourself, you were wrong\
Change the voices (Change the voice) in your head (In your head)\
Make them like you instead\
\
[Pre-Chorus 2]\
So complicated, look how we all make it\
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game\
It's enough, I've done all I can think of\
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh-oh\
[Chorus]\
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel\
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect\
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel\
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me\
\
[Bridge]\
The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear\
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer\
So cool in line, and we try, try, try\
But we try too hard, and it's a waste of my time\
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere\
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair\
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time\
Why do we do that? Why do I do that?\
Why do I do that?\
Yeah, oh, oh\
Pretty, pretty, pretty\
Yeah-eh\
\
[Chorus]\
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel\
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect\
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel\
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me\
[Outro]\
Yeah\
You're perfect, you're perfect\

My birthday cake, my soul, my dog, take everything I love\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
But, oh, one thing I'm never gonna do\

'All I Know So Far'\
\
\
I felt alone, still feel afraid\
I stumbled through it anyway\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I wish someone would have told me that this life is ours to choose\
No one's handing you the keys or a book with all the rules\
The little that I know I'll tell to you\
When they dress you up in lies and you're left naked with the truth\
\
[Chorus]\
You throw your head back and you spit in the wind\
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in\
Let 'em drag you through hell\
They can't tell you to change who you are\
That's all I know so far\
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain\
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain\
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars\
That's all I know so far\
That's all I know so far\
\
[Verse 2]\
So you might give yourself away, yeah\
And pay full price for each mistake\
But when the candy-coating hides the razor blade\
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I wish someone would have told me that this darkness comes and goes\
People will pretend but baby girl, nobody knows\
And even I can't teach you how to fly\
But I can show you how to live like your life is on the line\
\
[Chorus]\
You throw your head back and you spit in the wind\
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in\
Let 'em drag you through hell\
They can't tell you to change who you are\
That's all I know so far\
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain\
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain\
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars\
That's all I know so far\
\
[Refrain]\
That's all I know, that's all I know so far\
That's all I know, that's all I know so far\
That's all I know, that's all I know so far\
That's all I know, that's all I know so far\
\
[Bridge]\
I will be with you 'til the world blows up, yes\
Up, and down, and through 'til the world blows up\
Yeah\
When it's right, or it's all fucked up 'til the world blows up\
'Til the world blows up\
And we will be enough and until the world blows up\
[Chorus]\
Just throw your head back, and spit in the wind\
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in\
Let 'em drag you through hell\
They can't tell you to change who you are\
And when the storm's out, you run in the rain\
Put your sword down, dive right into the pain\
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars\
That's all I know so far\
\
[Refrain]\
That's all I know, that's all I know so far\
That's all I know, that's all I know so far\
That's all I know, that's all I know so far\
That's all I know, that's all I know so far\

'Blow Me (One Last Kiss)'\
\
\
Clenched shut jaw\
I've got another headache again tonight\
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire\
And they burn from all the tears\
I've been crying, I've been crying\
I've been dying over you\
Tie a knot in the rope\
Tryna hold, tryna to hold\
But there's nothing to grab\
So I let go\
\
[Chorus]\
I think I finally had enough\
I think I maybe think too much\
I think this might be it for us\
Blow me one last kiss\
You think I'm just too serious\
I think you're full of shit\
My head is spinning so\
Blow me one last kiss\
Just when it can't get worse\
I've had a shit day\
Have you had a shit day?\
We've had a shit day\
I think that life's too short for this\
I want back my ignorance and bliss\
I think I've had enough of this\
Blow me one last kiss\
[Verse 2]\
I won't miss\
All of the fighting that we always did\
Take it in\
I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left\
No more sick Whiskey dick\
No more battles for me\
You'll be calling a trick\
'Cause you no longer sleep\
I'll dress nice, I'll look good\
I'll go dancing alone\
I will laugh, I'll get drunk\
I'll take somebody home\
\
[Chorus]\
I think I finally had enough\
I think I maybe think too much\
I think this might be it for us\
Blow me one last kiss\
You think I'm just too serious\
I think you're full of shit\
My head is spinning so\
Blow me one last kiss\
Just when it can't get worse\
I've had a shit day\
Have you had a shit day?\
We've had a shit day\
I think that life's too short for this\
I want back my ignorance and bliss\
I think I've had enough of this\
Blow me one last kiss\
[Interlude]\
Da, da da da da, da da da da\
Blow me one last kiss\
Da, da da da da, da da da da\
Blow me one last kiss\
\
[Bridge]\
I will do what I please\
Anything that I want\
I will breathe, I will breathe\
I won't worry at all\
You will pay for your sins\
You'll be sorry, my dear\
All the lies, all the "why's" will all be crystal clear\
\
[Chorus]\
I think I finally had enough\
I think I maybe think too much\
I think this might be it for us\
Blow me one last kiss\
You think I'm just too serious\
I think you're full of shit\
My head is spinning so\
Blow me one last kiss\
Just when it can't get worse\
I've had a shit day\
Have you had a shit day?\
We've had a shit day\

I want back my ignorance and bliss\
I think I've had enough of this\
Blow me one last kiss\

La la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la la\
Blow me one last kiss\

Blow me one last kiss\

'Sober'\
\
\
I don't wanna be that call at four o'clock in the morning\
'Cause I'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Ah, sun is blinding\
I stayed up again\
Oh, I am finding\
That's not the way I want my story to end\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm safe up high\
Nothing can touch me\
Why do I feel this party's over?\
No pain inside\
You're my protection\
But how do I feel this good sober?\
\
[Verse 2]\
I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence\
The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth\
Please don't tell me that we had that conversation (I know we did)\
'Cause I won't remember, save your breath 'cause what's the use? (Ooh)\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Ah, the night is calling\
And it whispers to me softly, "Come and play"\
I, I am falling\
And if I let myself go, I'm the only one to blame\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm safe up high\
Nothing can touch me\
But why do I feel this party's over? (Oh, whoa, whoa)\
No pain inside\
You're like perfection\
But how do I feel this good sober? (Oh)\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down\
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round\
I'm looking for myself sober\
Comin' down, comin' down, comin' down\
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round\
Looking for myself sober\
\
[Bridge]\
When it's good then it's good, it's so good 'til it goes bad\
'Til you're tryin' to find the you that you once had\
I have heard myself cry, never again\
Broken down in agony and just tryin' to find a friend\
Oh\
Oh\
[Chorus]\
I'm safe up high\
Nothing can touch me (Nothing can touch me)\
But why do I feel this party's over? (But why do I feel this party's over?)\
No pain (No) inside (No)\
You're like perfection\
But how do I feel this good sober? (How do I feel this good sober?)\
I'm safe up high (Nothing)\
Nothing can touch me\
But why do I feel this party's over? (Over)\
No pain inside\

\
[Chorus]\
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started\
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started\
\
[Verse 1]\
Get this party started on a Saturday night\
Everybody's waiting for me to arrive\
Sending out the message to all of my friends\
We'll be looking flashy in my Mercedes Benz\
I got lots of style, check my gold diamond rings\
I can go for miles if you know what I mean\

[Chorus]\
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started\
(I'm comin' up, I'm comin')\
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started\

Pumping up the volume, breaking down to the beat\
Cruising through the Westside, we'll be checking the scene\
Boulevard is freaking as I'm coming up fast\
I'll be burning rubber, you'll be kissing my ass\
Pull up to the bumper, get out of the car\
License plate says, "Stunner: #1 Superstar"\
[Chorus]\
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started\
(I'm comin' up, so you better)\
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started\

Making my connection as I enter the room\
Everybody's chillin' as I set up the groove\
Pumping up the volume with this brand new beat\
Everybody's dancing and they're dancing for me\
I'm your operator, you can call anytime\
I'll be your connection to the party line\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started\

'A Million Dreams'\
\
\
Through the dark, through the door\
Through where no one\'92s been before\
But it feels like home\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy\
They can say, they can say I've lost my mind\
I don't care, I don\'92t care, if they call me crazy\
We can live in a world that we design\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause every night, I lie in bed\
The brightest colors fill my head\
A million dreams are keeping me awake\
I think of what the world could be\
A vision of the one I see\
A million dreams is all it's gonna take\
Oh, a million dreams for the world we're gonna make\
\
[Verse 2]\
There's a house we can build\
Every room inside is filled with things from far away\
Special things I compile\
Each one there to make you smile on a rainy day\
[Pre-Chorus]\
They can say, they can say it all sounds crazy\
They can say, they can say we've lost our minds\
See, I don't care, I don't care if they call us crazy\
Run away to a world that we design\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause every night, I lie in bed\
The brightest colors fill my head\
A million dreams are keeping me awake\
I think of what the world could be\
A vision of the one I see\
A million dreams is all it\'92s gonna take\
Oh, a million dreams for the world we\'92re gonna make\
\
[Bridge]\
However big, however small\
Let me be part of it all\
Share your dreams with me\
We may be right, we may be wrong\
But I wanna bring you along to the world I see\
To the world we close our eyes to see\
We close our eyes to see\
\
[Chorus]\
Every night, I lie in bed\
The brightest colors fill my head\
A million dreams are keeping me awake\
I think of what the world could be\
A vision of the one I see\
A million dreams is all it's gonna take\
A million dreams for the world we're gonna make\

How many times have I kicked you out of here\

[Verse 2]\
How did I become so obnoxious?\
What is it with you that makes me act like this?\
I've never been this nasty (Da-da-da-da-da)\
Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?\
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest\
But, baby, I don't mean it\
I mean it, I promise\

[Chorus]\
Please (Da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da), don't leave me\

'I Am Here'\
\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
I open up my heart\
You can love me or not\
There's no such thing as sin\
Let it all come right in\
I wanna make some mistakes, I wanna sleep in the mud\
I wanna swim in the flood, I wanna fuck 'till I'm done\
I like whiskey on ice, I like sun in my eyes\
I wanna burn it all down, so let's start a fire\
I wanna be lost, so lost that I'm found\
Naked and laughing with my blood on the ground (My blood on the ground)\
\
[Chorus]\
I am here, I am here\
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear\
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near\
I am here, I am here\
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here\
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Let me ask you\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Let me ask you\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Let me ask you\
[Verse 2]\
May the light be upon me\
May I feel in my bones that I am enough\
I can make anywhere home\
My fingers are clenched, my stomach's in knots\
My heart, it is racing, but afraid, I am not (Afraid I am not)\
\
[Chorus]\
I am here, I am here\
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear\
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near\
'Cause I am here, I am here\
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here\
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Let me ask you\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Let me ask you\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Let me ask you\
(Oh, ah)\
Oh (Oh, ah)\

I can think of one thousand places\
Much worse than this\

But I am here, I am here\
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear\
Know that I'll be ready when the devil is near\
'Cause I am here, I am here\
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here\
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Let me ask you\
Where does everybody go when they go?\
Where does everybody go when they go?\

'Just Like a Pill'\
\
\
I'm cryin' here, what have you done?\
I thought it would be fun\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I can't stay on your life support\
There's a shortage in the switch\
I can't stay on your morphine\
'Cause it's making me itch\
I said I tried to call the nurse again\
But she's bein' a little bitch\
I think I'll get outta here\
\
[Chorus]\
Where I can run, just as fast as I can\
To the middle of nowhere\
To the middle of my frustrated fears\
And I swear, you're just like a pill\
Instead of making me better\
You keep making me ill\
You keep making me ill\
\
[Verse 2]\
I haven't moved from the spot where you left me\
This must be a bad trip\
All of the other pills\
They were different\
Maybe I should get some help\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I can't stay on your life support\
There's a shortage in the switch\
I can't stay on your morphine\
'Cause it's making me itch\
I said I tried to call the nurse again\
But she's bein' a little bitch\
I think I'll get outta here\
\
[Chorus]\
Where I can run, just as fast as I can\
To the middle of nowhere\
To the middle of my frustrated fears\
And I swear, you're just like a pill\
Instead of making me better\
You keep making me ill\
You keep making me ill\
Run just as fast as I can\
To the middle of nowhere\
To the middle of my frustrated fears\
And I swear, you're just like a pill\
Instead of making me better\
You keep making me ill\
You keep making me ill\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I can't stay on your life support\
There's a shortage in the switch (Just like a pill)\
I can't stay on your morphine\
'Cause it's making me itch (Just like a pill)\
I said I tried to call the nurse again\
But she's bein' a little bitch (Just like a pill)\
I think I'll get outta here\
[Chorus]\
Where I can run, just as fast as I can\
To the middle of nowhere\
To the middle of my frustrated fears (Frustrated fears, I swear)\
And I swear, you're just like a pill\
Instead of making me better\
You keep making me ill\
You keep making me...\
Run just as fast as I can\
To the middle of nowhere\
To the middle of my frustrated fears\
And I swear, you're just like a pill\
Instead of making me better\
You keep making me ill (You're makin' me, makin me ill)\
You keep making me...\
Run just as fast as I can\
To the middle of nowhere (Ah)\
To the middle of my frustrated fears (Yeah)\
And I swear, you're just like a pill (Yeah)\
Instead of making me better (Oh-oh)\
You keep making me ill\
You keep making me ill (Oh, you're making me run)\
Run just as fast as I can\
To the middle of nowhere\

[Verse 1]\
Check it out, goin' out on the late night\
Lookin' tight, feelin' nice, it's a cock fight\
I can tell, I just know, that it's going down\
Tonight\
\
[Pre-Chorus 1]\
At the door, we don't wait 'cause we know them\
At the bar, six shots just beginnin'\
That's when dickhead put his hands on me\
But you see\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm not here for your entertainment\
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight\
Just stop and take a second\
I was fine before you walked into my life\
'Cause you know it's over\
Before it began\

It's just you and your hand tonight\

Uh-uh-uh-uh, ah, uh-uh, ah, oh\
Uh-uh-uh-uh, ah, uh-uh, ah, oh\

Midnight, I'm drunk, I don't give a fuck\
Wanna dance by myself, guess you're outta luck\
Don't touch, back up, I'm not the one\
A-buh-bye\

[Pre-Chorus 2]\
Listen up; it's just not happening\
You can say what you want to your boyfriends\
Just let me have my fun tonight\
Aight\

I'm not here for your entertainment\
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight\
Just stop and take a second\

Break-break-break-break-break it down (Oh)\
\
[Bridge]\
You're in the corner with your boys; you bet 'em five bucks\
You'd get the girl that just walked in, but she thinks you suck\
We didn't get all dressed up just for you to see\
So quit spilling your drinks on me, yeah\
\
[Interlude]\
You know who you are\
High fivin', talking shit, but you're goin' home alone, aren't ya?\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause I'm not here for your entertainment (No)\
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight\
Just stop and take a second (Just stop and take a second)\
I was fine before you walked into my life\
'Cause you know it's over (Know it's over)\
Before it began\
Keep your drink, just give me the money\
It's just you and your hand tonight (It's just you and your hand)\
I'm not here for your entertainment (No, no, no)\
You don't really wanna mess with me tonight\
Just stop and take a second (Just take a second)\

'TRUSTFALL'\
\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
Picture a place where it all doesn't hurt\
Where everything's safe and it doesn't get worse, oh my\
We see through bloodshot eyes\
Picture a place, somewhere else far away\
Where you know what they mean and they mean what they say to us\
And would that be enough?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Are we running out of time?\
Are we hiding from the light?\
Are we just too scared to fight for what we want tonight?\
\
[Chorus]\
Clos\uc0\u1077  your eyes and leav\u1077  it all behind\
Go where love is on our side\
It's a trust fall, baby\
It's a trust fall, baby\
You and I and everyone alive\
We can run into the fire\
It's a trust fall, baby\
Yeah, it's a trust fall, baby\
[Verse 2]\
Jump with me, come with me, burn like the sun\
We'll talk, then we'll cry, then we'll laugh 'til we're done, oh my\
It's like we're out our minds\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
We've been running for our lives\
We've been hiding from the light\
We've been far too scared to fight for what we want tonight\
\
[Chorus]\
Close your eyes and leave it all behind\
Go where love is on our side\
It's a trust fall, baby\
It's a trust fall, baby\
You and I and everyone alive\
We can run into the fire\
It's a trust fall, baby\
Yeah, it's a trust fall, baby\
\
[Bridge]\
What if we just fall?\
I'm not going without you\
You're not going alone\
I fell so far 'til I found you\
But you know what you know when you know\
So I'm not going without you\
You're not going alone\
'Cause you know when you know\
[Chorus]\
Close your eyes and leave it all behind\
Go where love is on our side\
It's a trust fall, baby\
It's a trust fall, baby\

'Stupid Girls'\

\
\
[Chorus]\
Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back\
Porno paparazzi girl (Yeah), I don't wanna be a stupid girl (Uh, uh)\
\
[Verse 1]\
Go to Fred Segal, you'll find them there\
Laughin' loud so all the little people stare\
Lookin' for a daddy to pay for the champagne (Drop a name)\
What happened to the dream of a girl president?\
She's dancing in the video next to 50 Cent\
They travel in packs of two and three\
With their itsy-bitsy doggies and their teeny-weeny tees\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Where, oh where, have the smart people gone?\
Oh where, oh where could they be? (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)\

Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl\
Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back\
(Yeah) Push up my bra like that\
I don't wanna be a stupid girl\
(Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh)\
(Let's break it down now)\
[Verse 2]\
The disease is growing, it's epidemic\
I'm scared that there ain't a cure\
The world believes it and I'm going crazy\
I cannot take anymore\
I'm so glad that I'll never fit in\
That will never be me\
Outcasts and girls with ambition\
That's what I wanna see (Come on)\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Disasters all around (Disasters all around)\
A world of despair (A world of despair)\
Your only concern: "Will it fuck up my hair?"\
\
[Chorus]\
Maybe if I act like that, that guy will call me back (Yeah, like this, woo)\
Porno paparazzi girl, I don't wanna be a stupid girl\
Baby, if I act like that, flippin' my blonde hair back (Uh-huh, uh-huh, and do your thing)\

Pull my hair, I'll suck it, girl, stupid girl\

Look away\
Uh, uh\
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh\
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\
\
[Verse 1]\
Mama, please stop crying, I can't stand the sound\
Your pain is painful and it's tearin' me down\
I hear glasses breaking, as I sit up in my bed\
I told dad you didn't mean those nasty things you said\
You fight about money, 'bout me and my brother\
And this I come home to, this is my shelter\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
It ain't easy growing up in World War III\
Never knowing what love could be, you'll see\
I don't want love to destroy me like it has done my family\
\
[Chorus]\
Can we work it out? (Can we?) Can we be a family? (Can we?)\
I promise I'll be better (I promise)\
Mommy, I'll do anything (I'll do anything)\

My mama, she loves you (I know it)\
No matter what she says, it's true\
I know that she hurts you, but remember, I love you, too\
\
[Middle 8]\
I ran away today\
Ran from the noise, ran away (Ran away)\
Don't wanna go back to that place\
But don't have no choice, no way\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
It ain't easy growin' up in World War III\
Never knowing what love could be, well, I've seen\
I don't want love to destroy me like it did my family\

[Chorus]\
Can we work it out? (Can we work it out? Oh, oh) Can we be a family?\

In our family portrait (In our family portrait)\
We look pretty happy (We look pretty happy)\
Let's play pretend, let's act like it comes naturally\

I don't want a step-brother anyways\
And I don't want my mom to have to change her last name, oh\

'Whatever You Want'\
\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
Running like a dog\
Fighting like I bitch too much\
And you just can't stand it, baby\
Even when I fall, you don't seem to give two shits\
'Cause you're just too cool, baby\
We could have it all\
But neither one of us would budge\
'Cause we can't be wrong, baby\
Folding up your arms, closing up your heart\
\
[Pre-Chorus 1]\
I know, I know, I know, you think it's me\
'Cause I want it all\
No, I know, I know, I know you see\
That we gotta talk\
You know, you know, you know, we must believe or fall apart\
\
[Chorus]\
I feel like our ship's going down tonight\
But it's always darkest before the light\
And that's enough for me to try\
Whatever you want\
Whatever you need\
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah\
Even if I say that it's over now\
Even if we want to move on somehow\
And just like that we come alive\
Whatever you want (Ah)\
Whatever you need (Yeah)\
Whatever you do, ah-ah-ah\
[Verse 2]\
Trying to get a breath\
Thinkin' 'bout the time you said that I was your heart, baby\
Trying to understand how a grown man goes on without a body part, baby\
I could walk away\
I could always cash my chips and I'd be ok, baby\
I would be ok, and you might be ok\
\
[Pre-Chorus 2]\
Oh, I know, I know, I know you think it's me\
'Cause ya want it all\
Now I know, I know, I know you see\
That we gotta talk\
No, you know, you know, you must believe\
You're enough for me\

I feel like our ship's going down tonight\
But it's always darkest before the light\
And that's enough for me to try\
Whatever you want (yeah)\

Even if I say that it's over now\
Even if we want to move on somehow\
And just like that we come alive\
Whatever you want (yeah)\
Whatever you need (ah)\
Whatever you do\
[Bridge]\
Whoever said that love was sweet?\
(Drank a little too much whiskey, baby)\
Whoever said that life was easy?\
(Never lived anywhere near me)\
I wouldn't change a thing\
'Cause you're the one I wanna sink with\
\
[Chorus]\
I feel like our ship's going down tonight\
But it's always darkest before the light\
And that's enough\
Even if I say that it's over now (it's over now)\
Even if we want to (if we want to move on somehow)\
Move on somehow\
And just like that we come alive\

'Don\'92t Let Me Get Me'\
\
\
Teachers dated me, my parents hated me\
I was always in a fight, 'cause I can't do nothing right\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Every day I fight a war against the mirror\
I can't take the person staring back at me\
I'm a hazard to myself\
\
[Chorus]\
Don't let me get me\
I'm my own worst enemy\
It's bad when you annoy yourself\
So irritating\
Don't wanna be my friend no more\
I wanna be somebody else\
I wanna be somebody else, yeah\
\
[Verse 2]\
LA told me, "You'll be a pop star\
All you have to change is everything you are."\
Tired of being compared to damn Britney Spears\
She's so pretty\
That just ain't me\
[Pre-Chorus]\
So doctor, doctor, won't you please prescribe me something?\
A day in the life of someone else\
'Cause I'm a hazard to myself\
\
[Chorus]\
Don't let me get me (No)\
I'm my own worst enemy\
It's bad when you annoy yourself\
So irritating (No)\
Don't wanna be my friend no more\
I wanna be somebody else, yeah\
Don't let me get me (Don't let me)\
I'm my own worst enemy (Oh)\
It's bad when you annoy yourself\
So irritating\
Don't wanna be my friend no more\
I wanna be somebody else\
\
[Bridge]\
So doctor, doctor, won't you please prescribe me something?\
A day in the life of someone else\
Don't let me get me\
\
[Chorus]\
Oh, I'm a hazard to myself, yeah\

I'm my own worst enemy\
It's bad when you annoy yourself (Yourself)\

'Glitter in the Air'\
\
\
Have you ever thrown a fistful of glitter in the air?\
Have you ever looked fear in the face and said, "I just don't care"?\
\
[Chorus]\
It's only half past the point of no return\
The tip of the iceberg, the sun before the burn\
The thunder before the lightning and the breath before the phrase\
Have you ever felt this way?\
\
[Verse 2]\
Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?\
Your whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone\
Have you ever been touched so gently you had to cry?\
Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside?\
\
[Chorus]\
It's only half past the point of oblivion\
The hourglass on the table, the walk before the run\
The breath before the kiss, and the fear before the flames\
Have you ever felt this way?\
\
[Bridge]\
La-la-la-la, la-la-la-la\
There you are\
Sitting in the garden\
Clutching my coffee\
Calling me sugar\
You called me sugar\
[Verse 3]\
Have you ever wished for an endless night?\
Lassoed the moon and the stars and pulled that rope tight?\
Have you ever held your breath and asked yourself\
\
\
\
'For Now'\
\
\
Then love showed its teeth like it's something vicious\
No, no, no, let me finish\
Ain't it something when it all goes tragic?\
How a spell can get casted onto something magic\
What I wouldn't give to get back to where we had it\
Oh, it should've lasted\
\
[Pre-Chorus 1]\
Now it's like I lied\
When I said I didn't need you\
Alright, if you'd left, I'd never be\
Tonight, can we just get it right?\
Somehow, for now\
\
[Chorus]\
Freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop\
And get back to the older familiar thoughts\
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop\
And get back to the feelings we think we lost?\
For now\
\
[Verse 2]\
Oh, I'm so goddamn mean\
'Cause I, I, I say and I do things\
That I shouldn't sometimes\
My mouth gets me in trouble all the time\
[Pre-Chorus 2]\
But now it's like I lied\
When I said I didn't need you\
I'd die, if you'd left, I'd never be\
Alright, can we just get it right somehow?\
For now\
\
[Chorus]\
Freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop\
And get back to the older familiar thoughts\
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop\
And get back to the feelings we think we lost?\
For now\
For now\
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop\
And get back to the feelings we think we've lost?\
For now\
\
[Bridge]\
Remember that time we were just kickin'?\
But nothing had changed, nothing was really different\
Then love showed its teeth like it's something vicious\
No, no, let me finish\
For now\
\
[Chorus]\
Freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop\
And get back to the older familiar thoughts\
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop\
And get back to the feelings we think we lost? (We lost)\
For now\
For now\
Can we just freeze frame, pause, rewind, stop\
And get back to the feelings we think we've lost?\
For now\
For now\
Can we just rewind, stop\

'Funhouse'\
\
\
Screaming down the halls\
Spinnin' all around and now we fall\
\
[Pre-Chorus 1]\
Pictures framing up the past\
Your taunting smirk behind the glass\
This museum full of ash\
Once a tickle, now a rash\
\
[Chorus]\
This used to be our funhouse\
But now it's full of evil clowns\
It's time to start the countdown\
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down\
I'm gonna burn it down\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one (Fun)\
\
[Verse 2]\
Echoes knockin' on locked doors\
All the laughter from before\
I'd rather live out on the street\
Than in this haunted memory\
[Pre-Chorus 2]\
I've called the movers, called the maids\
We'll try to exorcise this place\
Drag my mattress to the yard\
Crumble, tumble, house of cards\
\
[Chorus]\
This used to be our funhouse\
But now it's full of evil clowns\
It's time to start the countdown\
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down\
This used to be our funhouse\
But now it's full of evil clowns\
It's time to start the countdown\
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down\
I'm gonna burn it down (Down, down, down)\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one (Fun)\
(Down, down, down)\
\
[Bridge]\
Oh\
I'm crawling through the doggy door\
My key don't fit my lock no more\
I'll change the drapes\
I'll break the plates\
I'll find a new place\
Burn this fucker down\
[Interlude]\
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do\
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do\
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do\
Do, do, do, do, da, da, da, da\
Do-do-do-do, do-do, do\
(Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one)\
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do\
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do\
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do\
\
[Chorus]\
This used to be our funhouse\
But now it's full of evil clowns\
It's time to start the countdown\
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down\
This used to be our funhouse\
But now it's full of evil clowns\
It's time to start the countdown\

\
'Barbies'\
\
\
Oh, just like that my money's spent\
Where did it all go?\
Another night, another heart\
Another one leaves in the dark\
And I'm searching for my counterpart\
Where did they all go?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And I lock every single door\
And I look behind me even more\
Now turned in someone that I swore\
I would never be\
\
[Chorus]\
I wish I could go\
Back to playing Barbies in my room\
They never say\
That you gotta grow up quite this soon\
How fast things change\
And now I'm here and all I wanna do\
Is go back to playing barbies in my room\
\
[Verse 2]\
And I see it on my father's face\
Another line that comes with age\
I know that time will have its way\
Where did it all go?\
They say that things were simple then\
Although I don't remember when\
I wanna know what happens next\
Where do we all go?\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And I lock every single door\
And I look behind me even more\
And now turned into someone that I swore\
I would never be\
\
[Chorus]\
Oh, I wish I could go\
Back to playing Barbies in my room\
They never say\
That you gotta grow up quite this soon\
How fast things change\
And now I'm here and all I wanna do\
Is go back to playing barbies in my room\
\
[Bridge]\
Pink canopies and grass-stained knees\
Puttin' fireflies in a jar\
Gettin' home before it's dark (Mm)\
Scotch-taping posters on my wall\
Rollin' pixie sticks to smoke\
Couldn't wait 'til I was older\
\
[Chorus]\
But I wish I could go\
Back to playing Barbies in my room\
They never say\
That you gotta grow up quite this soon\
How fast things change\
And now I'm here and all I wanna do\
Is go back to playing Barbies in my room\
Back to playing Barbies in my\
[Outro]\
I wish that I could go back (Back)\
I wish that I could go back\

'Irrelevant'\
\
\
Took all the heat we could take\
And then burned it down\
Now it's a real parade\
We're all welcome now\
As long as you feel afraid\
That's what's it about\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
You can call me irrelevant, insignificant\
You can try to make me small\
I'll be your heretic, you fuckin' hypocrite\
I won't think of you at all\
Sticks and stones and all that shit\
Does Jesus love the ignorant?\
I like to think he'd gladly take us all\
\
[Chorus]\
The kids are not alright\
None of us are right\
I'm tired, but I won't sleep tonight\
'Cause I still feel alive\
The kids are not alright (The kids are not alright)\
None of us ar\uc0\u1077  right (None of us are right)\
I'm tired, but I won't sleep tonight (I might b\uc0\u1077  alive)\
'Cause I still feel alive\
[Verse 2]\
I can't tell the difference\
Between fight or flight\
I guess I'm indifferent\
Since I don't have the right\
I stay under covers now\
I'm afraid to go out\
I'll wait for tornadoes\
To come take me out\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
You can say that I'm ignorant, insignificant\
But I've been here all along\
I'll be your heretic, you fuckin' hypocrites\
You can't ever catch us all\
Sticks and stones and all that shit\
Does Jesus know I'm innocent?\
I'd like to think he'd gladly take us all\
\
[Chorus]\
The kids are not alright, no (The kids are not alright)\
None of us are right (None of us are right)\
I'm tired, but I won't sleep tonight (I might be alive)\
'Cause I still feel alive\
The kids are not alright (The kids are not alright)\
None of us are right (None of us are right)\
I'm tired, but I won't sleep tonight (I might be alive)\
'Cause I still feel alive\
Oh-oh, yeah\
[Bridge]\
Girls just wanna have rights\
So why do we have to fight? (Oh)\
Girls just wanna have rights\
So why do we have to fight? (Oh)\
Girls just wanna have rights\
So why do we have to fight? (Whoa, yeah)\
Girls just wanna have rights (Oh-oh, yeah)\
So why do we still have to fight? (Oh)\
\
[Chorus]\
The kids are not alright, no\
'Cause none of us are right\
I'm tired, but I won't sleep tonight\
'Cause I still feel alive\
These kids are not alright\
None of us are right\
I'm tired, but I won't sleep tonight\
I still feel alive\

'Wild Hearts Can\'92t Be Broken'\
\
\
I fight because I have to\
I fight for us to know the truth\
\
[Chorus]\
There's not enough rope to tie me down\
There's not enough tape to shut this mouth\
The stones you throw can make me bleed\
But I won't stop until we're free\
Wild hearts can't be broken\
No, wild hearts can't be broken\
\
[Verse 2]\
This is my rally cry\
I know it's hard, we have to try\
This is a battle I must win\
To want my share is not a sin\
\
[Chorus]\
There's not enough rope to tie me down\
There's not enough tape to shut this mouth\
The stones you throw can make me bleed\
But I won't stop until we're free\
'Cause wild hearts can't be broken\
No, wild hearts can't be broken\
[Bridge]\
You beat me, betray me\
You're losing, we're winning\
My spirit above me\
You cannot deny me\
My freedom is burning\
This broken world keeps turning\
I'll never surrender\
There's nothing, but a victory\
\
[Chorus]\
There's not enough rope to tie me down, oh\
There's not enough tape to shut this mouth\
The stones you throw can make me bleed\
But I won't stop until we're free\
Wild hearts can't be broken\

'But We Lost It'\
\
\
I wanna know, where does love go to die?\
Is it some sad empty castle in the sky?\
Did we just shoot too high and spoil like wine?\
\
[Chorus 1]\
You walk by and it's like our bodies never touch\
No love, you hold me close, but I don't feel much\
I cry, maybe time isn't on our side\
We had a thing, but we lost it\
One more go, I kinda thought if we took it slow\
It might be easier for us, yeah, for us to know\
I know we never been quite here before\
I wish I knew it when we lost it\
\
[Verse 2]\
You used to try to wake the beast in me\
There's still a very sleepy part of me inside\
I've been waiting to come alive\
You stared into my eyes and turned to stone\
And now I'm living all alone in these four walls\
\
[Chorus 2]\
There's a stranger, he's lying in my bed\
Kinda blank like the thoughts living in my head\
This is the one that I felt I knew so well\
I think we had it, but we lost it\
I'm still the girl that you chased all around the world\
I haven't changed, just replaced all the chains with pearls\
I want the same things we did back then\
I know we had it, but we lost it\
[Bridge]\
Oh, the bone breaks\
It grows back stronger\
Oh, the bone breaks\
It grows back stronger\
The bone breaks\
Yeah, it grows back stronger\
Oh, the bone breaks\
\
[Chorus 3]\
You walk by, and it's like our bodies never touch\
No love, you hold me close, but I don't feel much\
I cry, maybe time isn't on our side\
We had a thing, but we lost it\
One more go, I kinda thought if we took it slow\
It might be easier for us, yeah for us to know\
I know we never been quite here before\

'Secrets'\
\
\
What is wrong with me?\
It's what's wrong with you\
There's just so much I wanna say\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I like to make-believe with you\
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do\
That we always speak the truth... ish\
I like how we pretend the same\
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do\
Play this silly little game (Hey)\
\
[Chorus]\
I've got some things to say\
'Cause there's a lot that you don't know\
It's written on my face\
It's gonna be hard to swallow (Everybody's got a secret)\
I got some things to say (Everybody's got a secret)\
'Cause there's a lot that you don't know (Everybody's got a secret)\
It's written on my face (Everybody's got a secret)\
\
[Verse 2]\
I let the walls come down\
I let the monster out\
And it's coming after me (After me)\
Do you feel exposed\
Where it hurts the most?\
Can you wear it on your sleeve?\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I like to make-believe with you\
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do\
That we always speak the truth (Always speak the truth) ...ish\
I like how we pretend the same\
Da, da, da, da, do, do, do\
Play this silly little game (Hey)\

'Cause there's a lot that you don't know (Everybody's got a secret, yeah, yeah)\
It's written on my face (Everybody's got a secret, secret)\
\
[Bridge]\
Put it in the closet, lock the doors\
I'm wondering which one is worse\
Is it mine or is it yours? (Yours)\
Put it in the closet, lock the doors\
Wondering which one is worse\
I'll show mine if you show yours (Yours)\
I'll show mine if you show yours, oh\
He-he-hey\
[Chorus]\
(Everybody's got a secret, hoo)\
I got some things to say (Everybody's got a secret)\

'F**kin\'92 Perfect (Radio Edit)'\
\
\
Bad decisions, that's alright\
Welcome to my silly life\
\
[Pre-Chorus 1]\
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood\
Miss "Knowing it's all good\'94 it didn't slow me down\
Mistaken, always second guessing\
Underestimated, look, I'm still around\
\
[Chorus]\
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel\
Like you're less than, less than perfect\
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel\
Like you're nothing, you are perfect to me\
\
[Verse 2]\
You're so mean (You're so mean) when you talk (When you talk)\
About yourself, you were wrong\
Change the voices (Change the voice) in your head (In your head)\
Make them like you instead\
\
[Pre-Chorus 2]\
So complicated, look how we all make it\
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game\
It's enough, I've done all I can think of\
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh-oh\
[Chorus]\
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel\
Like you're less than, less than perfect\
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel\
Like you're nothing, you are perfect to me\
\
[Bridge]\
The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear\
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer\
So cool in line, and we try, try, try\
But we try too hard, and it's a waste of my time\
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere\
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair\
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time\
Why do we do that? Why do I do that?\
Why do I do that?\
Yeah, oh, oh\
Pretty, pretty, pretty\
Yeah-eh\
\
[Chorus]\
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel\
Like you're less than, less than perfect\
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel\
Like you're nothing, you are perfect to me\
Yeah, you're perfect, you're perfect to me\

'Where We Go'\
\
\
Comes a time when you know you must let go\
I know, I know\
We fixed it, but it's broken\
Got a feeling we gon' get this wrong\
And even I can't be this strong\
It's a breath that you take right before you die\
We lie and lie\
Can't say we didn't try though\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
So here we go\
Take my body, not my soul\
Took me high and left me low\
I honestly never imagined we'd get this far, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
There's a road that takes me home\
Take me fast or take me slow\
Throw my head out the window\
Feel the wind, make me whole\
Write my name up in the sky\
As we contemplate goodbye\
I don't know, we don't know, where we go\
[Verse 2]\
There's not a holy man or prayer in sight\
There's not a priest around to read our rites\
There's no magic balm to save our lives\
I know, I know\
We've both always been broken\
But you had a way of making me forget\
All the sadness rollin' 'round my head\
Well, that was until I wished us dead\
You had my heart\
I wish you would have kept it\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
This world we know\
It takes our bodies, not our souls\
It takes us high and leaves us low\
But they honestly never imagined we'd get this far\
\
[Chorus]\
There's a road that takes me home\
Take me fast or take me slow\
Throw my head out the window\
Feel the wind, make me whole\
Write my name up in the sky\
As we contemplate goodbye\
I don't know, we don't know, where we go\
[Bridge]\
Death is in the air tonight\
I can smell the fear inside\
We can see when we close our eyes\
That's it's alright, (it's alright), it's alright\
Promise me you'll stay with me (stay with me)\
If just for one more night (one more night)\
You can hold me honestly (honestly)\
'Cause it's alright, (it's alright), it's alright\
\
[Chorus]\
There's a road that takes me home\
Take me fast or take me slow\
Throw my head out the window\
Feel the wind, make me whole\
Write my name up in the sky\
As we contemplate goodbye\
I don't know, we don't know, where we go\

[Outro]\
There's a road that takes me home\
Take me fast or take me slow\

'Better Life'\
\
\
Don't tell me what you see\
That you actually believe it\
Fuck, I'm blue\
And all those photos that you like of a better life, better wife, better nights, better high\
Goddamn right I miss drinking\
Yeah, I do\
\
[Pre-Chorus 1]\
But I've been up late nights\
Staring at the street lights\
All the cigarette smoke, can't escape a closing window\
And my head's like "What happened to, it's alright?"\
Baby, It's not alright\
What if we're a closing window?\
\
[Chorus]\
But I can't shake the feeling\
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high\
I can't shake the feeling (I can't shake the feeling)\
Do you picture a better life?\
\
[Verse 2]\
I found myself up late feeling kinda jealous\
Looking at the bullshit, other people's wellness\
And it's got me thinking\
It's just not you (not you)\
I've been all night looking in the eyes of my baby\
Right in front of me, what a gift, so amazing\
Oh, that's what's true\
[Pre-Chorus 2]\
But I stay up late night\
Screaming at the street lights\
All the cigarette smoke, filling up these hopeless lungs\
Oh, and my head's like "What happened to, it's alright?"\
(What\'92s happened?)\
Baby, It's not alright\
I feel like a closing window\
\
[Chorus]\
But I can't shake the feeling (No, I can't shake the feeling)\
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high\
I can't shake the feeling (I can't shake the feeling, my baby)\
Do you picture a better life?\
\
[Bridge]\
I can't seem to understand it\
How did we get so low?\
No, no, no\
I can't seem to understand it\
How did we get so low? (How?)\
No, no, no\
\
[Chorus]\
But I can't shake the feeling (I can't seem to understand it, how did we get so low?)\
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high (no, no, no)\
I can't shake the feeling (I can't seem to understand it, how did we get so low?)\
Ooh, do you picture a better life?\
[Outro]\
Oooh\
Do you picture a better life?\
Ooh, do you picture a better life?\
And I wonder, and I wonder\
Do you picture a better life? (Mmm, can't shake the feeling)\
And I wonder (I can't shake the feeling)\

'All Out of Fight'\
\
\
It was just you and I\
When something dies, doesn't mean that it's over\
We're not like them, we don't have to be cold as ice\
We could be you and I\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
So take my hand for the last time\
And find my eyes with yours\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm all out of fight\
My heart will always know your name\
I'm all out of love\
But look at all the love we made\
I'm all out of life\
Oh, babe, it's killing me to say\
I'm all out of love, I'm all out of life\
I'm all out of fight\
\
[Verse 2]\
We were two brok\uc0\u1077 n parts from the same old junkyard\
Batter\uc0\u1077 d and bruised and we tried so goddamn hard\
To be you and I\
I'm proud of us, babe, 'cause we held through the pain\
And when everything hurt, we still ran through the rain and the night\
That was you and I\
[Pre-Chorus]\
So come here close for the last time\
Put your heart on mine, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm all out of fight\
My heart will always know your name\
I'm all out of love\
But look at all the love we made\
I'm all out of life\
Oh, babe, it's killing me to say\
I'm all out of love, I'm all out of life\
I'm all out of fight\
\
[Bridge]\
I never asked for easy\
But it shouldn't be this hard\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm all out of fight\
My heart will always know your name\
I'm all out of love\
But look at all the love we made\
I'm all out of life\
Oh, babe, it's killing me to say\
I'm all out of love, I'm all out of life\
I'm all out of fight, oh\
I'm all out of fight\
My heart will always know your name\
I'm all out of love\
But look at all the love we made\
I'm all out of life\
Oh, babe, it's killing me to say\

'Hustle'\
\
\
[Verse 1: P!nk]\
I gave you soft, I gave you sweet\
Just like a lion, you came for a sheep\
Oh no, don't try to hustle me\
You took my love, mistook it for weakness\
I guarantee I won't repeat this\
No, don't try to hustle me (Don't try to hustle me)\

I live my life like a bullet in a gun\
Give you all my love 'til my patience is done\

A boy like you, you think you know it all\
Build it up and you're bound to fall\
Oh no-oh-oh, don't try to hustle me (Don't try to hustle me)\
I spend my days tryna do you right\
But you've been blind, you can't see the light\
Oh no-oh-oh-oh-oh, don't try to hustle me\

Don't fuck with me (Whoop, whoop)\
Yeah, don't hustle me (Whoop, whoop)\
\
[Bridge: P!nk]\
'Cause it won't do no good at all to say you're sorry now\
Your words, they are falling on deaf ears\
And it won't do no good at all to try to work it out\
How can you replace all these years?\
'Cause now you've gone and thrown away\
The very thing you need\
Bitch, please, don't try to hustle me\
[Chorus: P!nk & Dan Reynolds]\
Don't hustle me (Whoop, whoop)\
Don't hustle me (Whoop, whoop)\

'You Get My Love'\
\
\
All of my pointless doubts\
Where I went wrong\
I whispered the ways that I'm ashamed of myself\
While you were dreaming, I handed you all my fears\
My thoughtless decisions, turned into thoughtful tears\
What have I done for the first time\
I blame myself\
\
[Chorus]\
But you get my love, baby\
You get my love\
If there's only one thing about me that you can trust\
You get my love, baby\
You get my love\
Don't let my mistakes take that away from us\
You get my love\
\
[Verse 2]\
I'm no longer hiding\
Though you're not awake to leave\
I can tell by your breathing\
It's no longer a fantasy\
I'm still not prepared\
For when you wake up and turn to me\
[Chorus]\
But you get my love, baby\
You get my love\
If there's only one thing about me that you can trust\
You get my love, baby\
You get my love\
Don't let my mistakes take that away from us\
You get my love\
\
[Bridge]\
The light comes in\
The dawn is rising down\
You opened up your eyes\
Once again I have to risk it all\
The time is now\
\

But you get my love, baby\
You get my love\
If there's only one thing about me that you can trust\
You get my love, baby\
You get my love\
Don't let my mistakes take that away from us\
You get my love, baby\
You get my love\
If there's only one thing about me that you can trust\
You get my love, baby\

'I Don\'92t Believe You'\

It's like the way we fight, the times I cry\
We come to blows and every night\
The passion's there, so it's gotta be right, right?\
\
[Chorus]\
No, I don't believe you\
When you say, "Don't come around here no more"\
I won't remind you\
You said we wouldn't be apart\
No, I don't believe you\
When you say you don't need me anymore\
So don't pretend to\
Not love me at all\
\
[Verse 2]\
I don't mind it, I still don't mind at all\
It's like one of those bad dreams when you can't wake up\
It looks like you've given up, you've had enough\
But I want more, no, I won't stop\
'Cause I just know you'll come around, right?\
\

No, I don't believe you\
When you say, "Don't come around here no more"\

So don't pretend to\
Not love me at all\

Just don't stand there and watch me fall\

It's like the way we fight, the times I cry\
We come to blows and every night\
The passion's there, so it's gotta be right, right?\

No, I don't believe you\
When you say, "Don't come around here no more"\

So don't pretend to\
Not love me at all\

'Happy'\

\
\
[Verse 1]\
Since I was 17\
I\'92ve always hated my body\
And it feels like my body\'92s hated me\
Can somebody find me a pill\
To make me un-afraid of me?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Seen every therapist, but I\'92m a cynical bitch\
Don\'92t like to talk about my feelings\
I take another hit, I find another fake fix\
\'91Cause it\'92s easier than healing\
\
[Chorus]\
I don\'92t wanna be this way forever\
Keep telling myself that I\'92ll get better\
Every time I try, I always stop me\
Maybe I\'92m just scared to be happy\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Mmm, may\'97\
[Verse 2]\
Since I was 22\
I\'92ve been with somebody who loves me\
And I\'92ve been tryna believe it\'92s true, mmm\
But my head always messes up my heart\
No matter what I do\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Seen every therapist, but I\'92m a cynical bitch\
Don\'92t like to talk about my feelings\
I take another sip, I swear it\'92s my last fix\

'Cause I don\'92t wanna be this way forever\
Keep telling myself that I\'92ll get better\

'Circle Game'\
\
\
And there's still monsters in my closet and they want to come and play\
There's still sounds in the dark, I wish they'd go away\
I know, I know, I know, I know I'm a big girl now\
I know, I know, I know, I know I better work it out\
I've got a little girl of my own and she looks at me\
Like I'm a badass and you know that I wanna be\
And now there's monsters in her closet and they wanna come and play\
And I start looking for my dad to come and make 'em go away\
I know, I know, I know, I know that it's my job now\
I know, I know, I know, I know I better work it out\

I had a hard day, and I need to find a hiding place\
Can you give me just a second to make it through these growing pains?\
And I know that it's just life and I must go through things alone\
But I'm feeling kinda small, I want his hand to hold\
I know, I know, I know, I know I'm a big girl now\
Yeah, I know, I know, I know, I know we all just work it out\

And what goes out, does it come back in?\
And we have to say goodbye, can we say hello again?\
Oh, where's the book that shows you how to be a big girl now?\
Can I fall apart one more time before I work it out?\
\

'Today\'92s the Day'\
\
\
Been kinda bored lately\
I hate on all I see\
It's all mundane to me\
This box I've painted pains me\
\
[Pre-Chorus 1]\
But you could watch me\
You could help me down the rabbit hole with you\
I could go with you\
You could lead the way\
I'd go hand in hand with you (Oh-oh-oh-oh)\
\
[Chorus]\
Today's the day I've been waiting for\
Tomorrow won't come after all\
Yesterday's so far away\
This today's the only day\
Somebody please stop the clock (Oh-oh-oh)\
Don't ever let this day stop (Oh-oh-oh)\
I never wanna go home\
No, no, no, no, no\
\
[Verse 2]\
I used to wanna grow up\
I thought that I could be free\
But now I'm realizin'\
It's cool, it ain't for me\
It's cool 'cause all my dreams\
Are more than possibilities\
[Pre-Chorus 2]\
I get so vicious\
When I don't feel delicious\
I just need a friend\
So much to carry\
These days are kinda scary\
I don't want the fun to end (Oh-oh-oh-oh)\
\
[Chorus]\
Today's the day I've been waiting for\
Tomorrow won't come after all\
Yesterday's so far away\

'My Attic'\
\
\
My attic is full of bones and full of hopeless\
Young emotions that just won't grow up\
\
[Chorus]\
I keep hiding the keys in all these\
Places even I can't find\
Hoping, one day, you'll find them all\
And I wanna let you see inside my attic\
\
[Verse 2]\
Inside this olive skin are paper thin\
Illusions that I'm tougher than I am\
And I'm guarded, castle walls from all the falls\
And break up calls and never should've beens\
\
[Chorus]\
But don't go pushing too hard\
I'm not so easy to manipulate\
I will give you all of my secrets\
If you promise you can brave my attic\
\
[Bridge]\
And I swear, not tryna be vindictive\
I'm just terrified that you might see me different\
You'll change your mind, tell me that I'm crazy\
Tell me that I'm okay, tell me that you'll stay\
[Verse 3]\
'Cause my attic is silver plans and one night stands\
That numbers can't begin to calculate\
My attic is up the stairs and waiting there\
Are lonely nights, they keep me wide awake\
\
[Chorus]\
I keep hiding the keys in all these\
Places even I can't find\
Hoping, one day, you'll find them all\
'Cause I wanna let you see inside my attic\

'I\'92m Not Dead'\
\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
There's always cracks\
A crack of sunlight\
A crack in the mirror or on your lips\
It's the morning on a sunset Friday\
When all conversations twist\
It's the fifth day of ice on a new tattoo\
But the ice should be on our heads\
We only spun the web to catch ourselves\
So we weren't left for dead\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And I was never lookin' for approval from anyone but you\
And though this journey's over, I'd go back if you ask me to\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm not dead, just floating\
Right between the ink on your tattoo\
In the belly of the beast we turned into\
I'm not scared, just changing\
Right behind the cigarette and the devilish smile\
You're my crack of sunlight\
[Verse 2]\
You can do the math a thousand ways, but you can't erase the facts\
That others come and others go, but you always come back\
I'm the winter flower underground, always thirsty for summer rain\
And just like the change of seasons\
I know you'll be back again\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm not dead, just floating\
Underneath the ink of my tattoo\
I've tried to hide my scars from you\
I'm not scared, just changing\
Right behind the cigarette and the devilish smile\
You're my crack of sunlight, oh\
\
[Bridge]\
I'm not dead just yet\
I'm not dead, I'm just floating\
Doesn't matter where I'm going\
I'll find you (I'm not scared at all)\
Underneath the cuts and bruises\
Finally gained what no one loses\
I'll find you (I will find you)\
\
[Outro]\
I'm not dead, just floating\
\
\
\
'There You Go'\
\
\
And I don't wanna hear that you adore me\
And I know that all you're doing is playin' your mind games\
Don't you know that game beats these games?\
So your best bet is to be straight with me\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
So you say you wanna talk, let's talk\
If you won't talk, I'll walk\
Yeah, it's like that\
I got a new man, he's waiting out back\
Now what, whatcha think about that?\
Now when I say I'm through, I'm through\
Basically, I'm through with you\
Whatcha wanna say, had to have it your way, had to play games\
Now you're begging me to stay\
\
[Chorus]\
There you go, looking pitiful\
Just because I let you go\
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back\
But sometimes it be's like that, so\
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go\
There you go because your lies got old\
Look at you, there you go\
[Verse 2]\
Please don't come around talking about how you changed\
How you said good-bye to what's her name\
All it sounds like to me is new game\
And I was right when I thought I'd be much better off without you\
Had to get myself from 'round you, because my life was all about you\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
So you say you wanna talk, I don't\
Say you wanna change, I won't\
Yeah, it's like that\
Had your chance, won't take you back\
Now what, what you think about that?\
And when I say I'm through, I'm through\
Basically I'm through with you\
What you wanna say?\
Had to have it your way, had to play games, now you're begging me to stay\
\
[Chorus]\
There you go, looking pitiful\
Just because I let you go\
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back\
But sometimes it be's like that, so\
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go\
There you go because your lies got old\
Look at you, there you go\
[Bridge]\
Oh, don't you wish you could turn the hands of time\
Don't you wish you still were mine?\
Don't you wish I'd take you back?\
Don't you wish that things were simple like that, oh?\
Didn't miss a good thing 'til it's gone\
But I knew it wouldn't be long, till you came running back\
Missing my love, there you go\
\
[Chorus]\
There you go, looking pitiful\
Just because I let you go\
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back\
But sometimes it be's like that, so\
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go\
There you go because your lies got old\
Look at you, there you go\
There you go, looking pitiful\
Just because I let you go\
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back\
But sometimes it be's like that, so\
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go\
There you go because your lies got old\
Look at you, there you go\
There you go, looking pitiful\
Just because I let you go\
There you go, talking 'bout you want me back\
But sometimes it be's like that, so\
There you go, talking 'bout you miss me so, that you love me so Why I let you go\
There you go because your lies got old\
Look at you, there you go\

'Turbulence'\
\
\
But we both can't live without it and we tried\
We should take our own advice\
Mm, don't give up\
There's a mountain in the middle of the road\
It'll take a little longer to get home\
Baby, all we've got is time\
\
[Chorus]\
You can't help when your stomach sinks\
See your life happen in a flash\
In your head, it could be so real\
That you almost feel the crash\
The panic is temporary\
But I'll be permanent\
So when it hits, don't forget\
As scary as it gets, it's just turbulence\
\
[Verse 2]\
Close your eyes\
Pretend you're driving on a bumpy road at night\
You can meet me in the corners of your mind\
We can build a new cloud nine\
Hey, if you're alive\
Then it means that you're committed to survive\
That's enough to drain the life from you sometimes\
But I hold on tight\
[Chorus]\
You can't help when your stomach sinks\
See your life happen in a flash (Yeah)\
In your head, it could be so real\
That you almost feel the crash (Oh)\
The panic is temporary\
But I'll be permanent\
So when it hits, don't forget\
As scary as it gets, it's just turbulence\
\
[Bridge]\
Hold my hand, hold your breath\
And I'll find a place to land\
Where you're safe, never break\
When the morning never ends\
When you say that you can't\
I will watch you dance through this turbulence\
It's turbulence (Oh)\
\
[Chorus]\
You can't help when your stomach sinks\
See your life happen in a flash\
In your head, it could be so real (It could be so real)\
That you almost feel the crash (Feel the crash)\
The panic is temporary\
But I'll be permanent\
So when it hits, don't forget\
As scary as it gets, it's just turbulence\

Earned all this money but they never take the country out me\
I got hot sauce in my bag, swag\

'If I Were a Boy'\
\
\
I'd roll out of bed in the morning\
And throw on what I wanted then go\
Drink beer with the guys\
And chase after girls\
I'd kick it with who I wanted\
And I'd never get confronted for it\
'Cause they'd stick up for me\
\
[Chorus]\
If I were a boy\
I think I could understand\
How it feels to love a girl\
I swear I'd be a better man\
I'd listen to her\
'Cause I know how it hurts\
When you lose the one you wanted\
'Cause he's taken you for granted\
And everything you had got destroyed\
\
[Verse 2]\
If I were a boy\
I would turn off my phone\
Tell everyone it's broken\
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone\
I'd put myself first\
And make the rules as I go\
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful\
Waitin' for me to come home\
To come home\

It's a little too late for you to come back\
Say, it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that\
If you thought I would wait for you\
You thought wrong\
\
[Chorus]\
But you're just a boy\
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)\
How it feels to love a girl\
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man\
You don't listen to her\
You don't care how it hurts\
Until you lose the one you wanted\
'Cause you've taken her for granted\
And everything you have got destroyed\

'Hold Up'\

\
Back up, they don't love you like I love you\
Step down, they don't love you like I love you\

What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you\
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you\
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you\
\
[Verse 1]\
Something don't feel right because it ain't right\
Especially comin' up after midnight\
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect\
To ever feel this worthless\
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list\
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch\
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun\
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one\

What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?\
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately\

Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets\
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets\
Would they be down to ride? No\
They used to hide from you, lie to you\
But y'all know we were made for each other\
So I find you and hold you down\
Me sing se\

So rock right up to the side of my mountain\
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak\
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain\
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep\

Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe\
And wash me over until my well runs dry\
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me\

\
[Verse 1]\
I can't believe I believed everything we had would last\
So young and naive of me to think she was from your past\
Silly of me to dream of one day havin' your kids\
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong\
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that\
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man\
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women\
It took me some time, but now I moved on\
Because I realized I've got\
\
[Chorus]\
Me, myself and I\
That's all I got in the end, that's what I found out\
And it ain't no need to cry\
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend\
Me, myself and I\
That's all I got in the end, that's what I found out\
And it ain't no need to cry\
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend\

Even your very best friend tried to warn me on the low\
Took me some time, but now I am strong\
Because I realized I've got\

Hold rosaries, and sing in stained glass symphonies\
Cleanse me, Holy Trinity\
From this marijuana smoke smell in my hair\

I sashayed my dress\
Did my best impression of a damsel in distress\
This alcohol and smell of regret\
Allured my catch\
Outfit too small to hide my scars\
Feelin' bottled up like bottle service broads\
How long can he hold his breath before his death?\

'Denial (Lemonade Poem, Part 2)'\
\
\
Tried to be soft, prettier\
Less... awake\
Fasted for 60 days\
Wore white\
Abstained from mirrors\
Abstained from sex\
Slowly did not speak another word\
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles\
I slept on a mat on the floor\
I swallowed a sword\
I levitated\
Into the basement\
Confessed my sins\
And was baptized in a river\
Got on my knees and said, "Amen"\
And said, "I mean"\
I whipped my own back\
And asked for dominion at your feet\
I threw myself into a volcano\
I drank the blood and drank the wine\
I sat alone and begged and bent at the waist for God\
I crossed myself in thought\
I saw the devil\
I grew thickened skin on my feet\
I bathed in bleach\
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book\
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know\
\
\
\
'Ave Maria'\
\
\
I know the cost of a losing hand\
There, but for the grace of God, oh, I\
\
[Chorus]\
I found Heaven on Earth\
You are my last, my first\
And then I hear this voice inside\
Ave Maria\
\
[Verse 2]\
I've been alone when I'm surrounded by friends\
How could the silence be so loud?\
But I still go home knowing that I've got you\
There's only us when the lights go down\
\
[Chorus]\
You are my Heaven on Earth\
You are my hunger, my thirst\
I always hear this voice inside\
Singing Ave Maria\
\
[Bridge]\
Sometimes, love can come and pass you by\
While you're busy makin' plans\
Suddenly hit you and then you realize\

There's such a difference between us\
And a million miles\
[Chorus]\
Hello from the other side\
I must've called a thousand times\
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done\
But when I call, you never seem to be home\

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart\
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore\

Hello, how are you?\
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry\

It's no secret that the both of us\
Are running out of time\

Didn't get the chance to\
Feel the world around me\

But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it\

'Set Fire to the Rain'\
\
\
I let it fall, my heart\
And as it fell, you rose to claim it\
It was dark, and I was over\
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me\
My hands, they were strong\
But my knees were far too weak\
To stand in your arms\
Without falling to your feet\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
But there's a side to you\
That I never knew, never knew\
All the things you'd say\
They were never true, never true\
And the games you'd play\
You would always win, always win\
\
[Chorus]\
But I set fire to the rain\
Watched it pour as I touched your face\
Well, it burned while I cried\
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name\
Your name\
[Verse 2]\
When I lay with you\
I could stay there, close my eyes\
Feel you here forever\
You and me together, nothing is better\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
'Cause there's a side to you\
That I never knew, never knew\
All the things you'd say\
They were never true, never true\

But I set fire to the rain\
Watched it pour as I touched your face\
Well, it burned while I cried\
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name\
Your name\
I set fire to the rain\
And I threw us into the flames\
When we fell, somethin' died\
'Cause I knew that that was the last time\
The last time\
[Bridge]\
Sometimes, I wake up by the door\
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you\
Even now, when we're already over\
I can't help myself from lookin' for you\
\
[Chorus]\
I set fire to the rain\
Watched it pour as I touched your face\
Well, it burned while I cried\
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name\

When we fell, somethin' died\

Finally, I can see you crystal clear\
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare\

Don't underestimate the things that I will do\
There's a fire starting in my heart\
Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
The scars of your love remind me of us\
They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all\
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless\
I can't help feeling\

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)\
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)\
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\
\
[Verse 2]\
Baby, I have no story to be told\
But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn\
Think of me in the depths of your despair\
Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared\

Could've had it all\
Rolling in the deep\
You had my heart inside of your hand\
But you played it with a beating\

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)\
We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\
We could've had it all, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)\
It all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\
[Chorus]\
We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)\
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)\
And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\
Could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)\
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)\
You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)\

'When We Were Young'\
\
\
Everybody here is watching you\
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true\
But, if by chance, you're here alone\
Can I have a moment before I go?\
'Cause I've been by myself all night long\
Hoping you're someone I used to know\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
You look like a movie, you sound like a song\
My God, this reminds me of when we were young\
\
[Chorus]\
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time\
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised\
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless\
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song\
\
[Verse 2]\
I was so scared to face my fears\
Nobody told me that you'd be here\
And I swear you'd moved overseas\
That's what you said when you left me\
[Pre-Chorus]\
You still look like a movie, you still sound like a song\
My God, this reminds me of when we were young\
\
[Chorus]\
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time\
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised\
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless\
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
(When we were young)\
(When we were young)\
(When we were young)\
(When we were young)\
\
[Bridge]\
It's hard to admit that (When we were young)\
Everything just takes me back (When we were young)\
To when you were there (When we were young)\
To when you were there\
And a part of me keeps holding on (When we were young)\
Just in case it hasn't gone (When we were young)\
I guess I still care (When we were young)\
Do you still care?\
[Break]\
It was just like a movie, it was just like a song\
My God, this reminds me of when we were young\
(When we were young)\
(When we were young)\
(When we were young)\
(When we were young)\
\
[Chorus]\
Let me photograph you in this light in case it is the last time\
(When we were young, when we were young)\
That we might be exactly like we were before we realised\
(When we were young, when we were young)\
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless\
(When we were young, when we were young)\
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless\
(When we were young, when we were young)\
\
\
\
'All I Ask'\
\
\
They've all been said before, you know\
So why don't we just play pretend\
Like we're not scared of what is coming next\
Or scared of having nothing left?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Look, don't get me wrong\
I know there is no tomorrow\
All I ask is\
\
[Chorus]\
If this is my last night with you\
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend\
Give me a memory I can use\
Take me by the hand while we do\
What lovers do\
It matters how this ends\
'Cause what if I never love again?\
\
[Verse 2]\
I don't need your honesty\
It's already in your eyes\
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me\
No one knows me like you do\
And since you're the only one that mattered\
Tell me, who do I run to?\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Look, don't get me wrong\
I know there is no tomorrow\
All I ask is\
\
[Chorus]\
If this is my last night with you\
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend\
Give me a memory I can use\
Take me by the hand while we do\
What lovers do\
It matters how this ends\
'Cause what if I never love again?\
\
[Bridge]\
Let this be our lesson in love\
Let this be the way we remember us\
I don't want to be cruel or vicious\
And I ain't asking for forgiveness\
All I ask is\
\
[Chorus]\
If this is my last night with you\
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend\
Give me a memory I can use\
Take me by the hand while we do\
What lovers do\
\

\
'Send My Love (To Your New Lover)'\
\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
This was all you, none of it me\
You put your hands on, on my body and told me, mmm\
You told me you were ready\
For the big one, for the big jump\
I'd be your last love, everlasting, you and me, mmm\
That was what you told me\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I'm giving you up\
I've forgiven it all\
You set me free\
\
[Chorus]\
Send my love to your new lover\
Treat her better\
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts\
We both know we ain't kids no more\
Send my love to your new lover\
Treat her better\
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts\
We both know we ain't kids no more\
[Verse 2]\
I was too strong, you were trembling\
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (Rising), mmm\
Baby, I'm still rising\
I was running, you were walking\
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (Down), mmm\
There's only one way down\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I'm giving you up\
I've forgiven it all\
You set me free, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
Send my love to your new lover\
Treat her better\
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts\
We both know we ain't kids no more\
Send my love to your new lover\
Treat her better\
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts\
We both know we ain't kids no more\
\
[Bridge]\
If you're ready, if you're ready\
If you're ready, I am ready\
If you're ready, if you're ready\
We both know we ain't kids no more\
No, we ain't kids no more\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I'm giving you up\
I've forgiven it all\
You set me free\
\
[Chorus]\
Send my love to your new lover\
Treat her better\
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts\
We both know we ain't kids no more\
Send my love to your new lover\
Treat her better\
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts\
We both know we ain't kids no more\
\
[Outro]\
If you're ready, if you're ready\
(Send my love to your new lover)\
If you're ready, are you ready?\
(Treat her better)\
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts\
We both know we ain't kids no more\
If you're ready, if you're ready\
(Send my love to your new lover)\
If you're ready, are you ready?\
(Treat her better)\

\
'To Be Loved'\
\
\
I'm as lost now as I was back then\
Always make a mess of everything\
It's about time that I face myself\
All I do is bleed into someone else\
Painting walls with all my secret tears\
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
But, oh, my\
Oh, my\
I'll never learn if I never leap\
I'll always yearn if I never speak\
\
[Chorus]\
To be loved and love at the highest count\
Means to lose all the things I can't live without\
Let it be known that I will choose to lose\
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie\
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried\
\
[Verse 2]\
I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide\
I'll be the one to catch myself this time\
Tryna learn to lean into it all\
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?\
Looking back, I don't regret a thing\
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning\
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by\
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right\
[Pre-Chorus]\
But, oh, my\
Oh, my\
I'll never learn if I never leap\
I'll always yearn if I never speak\
\
[Chorus]\
To be loved and love at the highest count\
Means to lose all the things I can't live without\
Let it be known that I will choose to lose\
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie\
Let it be known\
\
[Bridge]\
Let it be known that I cried for you\
Even started lying to you\
What a thing to do\
All because I wanted\
\
[Chorus]\
To be loved and love at the highest count\
Means to lose all the things I can't live without\
Let it be known, known, known\
That I will choose, I will lose\
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie\
Let it be known\
\
\
\
'Skyfall'\
\
\
Feel the Earth move, and then\
Hear my heart burst again\
For this is the end\
I've drowned and dreamt this moment\
So overdue, I owe them\
Swept away, I'm stolen\
\
[Chorus]\
Let the sky fall\
When it crumbles\
We will stand tall\
Face it all together\
Let the sky fall\
When it crumbles\
We will stand tall\
Face it all together at Skyfall\
At Skyfall\
\
[Verse 2]\
Skyfall is where we start\
A thousand miles and poles apart\
Where worlds collide and days are dark\
You may have my number, you can take my name\
But you'll never have my heart\
[Chorus]\
Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)\
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)\
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)\
Face it all together\
Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)\
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)\
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)\
Face it all together at Skyfall\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Let the sky fall\
When it crumbles\
We will stand tall\
Let the sky fall\
When it crumbles\
We will stand tall\
\
[Bridge]\
Where you go I go\
What you see I see\
I know I'd never be me without the security\
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm\
Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand\
\
[Chorus]\
Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)\
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)\
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)\
Face it all together\
Let the sky fall (Let the sky fall)\
When it crumbles (When it crumbles)\
We will stand tall (We will stand tall)\
Face it all together at Skyfall\
[Outro]\
Let the sky fall\
We will stand tall\

\
'Make You Feel My Love'\
\
\
I could offer you a warm embrace\
To make you feel my love\
\
[Verse 2]\
When the evening shadows and the stars appear\
And there is no one there to dry your tears\
I could hold you for a million years\
To make you feel my love\
\
[Bridge 1]\
I know you haven't made your mind up yet\
But I will never do you wrong\
I've known it from the moment that we met\
No doubt in my mind where you belong\
\
[Verse 3]\
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue\
I'd go crawling down the avenue\
Know there's nothing that I wouldn't do\
To make you feel my love\
\
[Instrumental Break]\
[Bridge 2]\
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea\
And on the highway of regret\
The winds of change are blowing wild and free\
You ain't seen nothing like me yet\
\
[Verse 4]\
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true\
Nothing that I wouldn't do\
Go to the ends of the earth for you\
\
\
\
'Water Under the Bridge'\
\
\
If you're not the one for me\
Why do I hate the idea of being free?\
And if I'm not the one for you\
You've gotta stop holdin' me the way you do\
Oh, honey, if I'm not the one for you\
Why have we been through what we have been through?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
It's so cold out here (Here, here, here)\
In your wilderness (Eh, eh, eh)\
I want you to be my keeper (Eh, eh, eh)\
But not if you are so reckless\
\
[Chorus]\
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently\
Don't pretend that you don't want me\
Our love ain't water under the bridge\
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently\
Don't pretend that you don't want me\
Our love ain't water under the bridge\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Woah\
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge\
[Verse 2]\
What are you waiting for?\
You never seem to make it through the door\
And who are you hiding from?\
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run\
Have I ever asked for much?\
The only thing that I want is your love\
\
[Chorus]\
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently\
Don't pretend that you don't want me\
Our love ain't water under the bridge\
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently\
Don't pretend that you don't want me\
Our love ain't water under the bridge\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Woah\
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
It's so cold (Here, here, here)\
In your wilderness (Eh, eh, eh)\
I want you to be my keeper (Eh, eh, eh)\
But not if you are so reckless (Ooh)\
[Chorus]\
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently\
Don't pretend that you don't want me\
Our love ain't water under the bridge\
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently\
Don't pretend that you don't want me\
Our love ain't water under the bridge\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Woah\
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)\
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)\
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge\
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)\
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)\
Woah\
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)\
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)\
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge\
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)\
(Say it ain't so, say it ain't so)\

'Chasing Pavements'\
\
\
If I'm wrong, I am right\
Don't need to look no further\
This ain't lust, I know this is love, but\
If I tell the world, I'll never say enough\
'Cause it was not said to you\
And that's exactly what I need to do if I end up with you\
\
[Chorus]\
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements\
Even if it leads nowhere?\
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?\
Should I leave it there?\
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements\
Even if it leads nowhere?\
\
[Verse 2]\
I build myself up and fly around in circles\
Waiting as my heart drops\
And my back begins to tingle\
Finally, could this be it, or?\
\
[Chorus]\
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements\
Even if it leads nowhere?\
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?\
Should I leave it there?\
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements\
Even if it leads nowhere? Yeah\
[Breakdown]\
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements\
Even if it leads nowhere?\
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?\
Should I leave it there?\
Should I give up or should I just keep on chasing pavements?\
Should I just keep on chasing pavements?\
Oh-oh\
\
[Chorus]\
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements\
Even if it leads nowhere?\
Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?\
Should I leave it there?\
\
\
\
'I Drink Wine'\
\
\
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down\
By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow\
When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind\
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine\
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice\
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')\
To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')\
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser\
\
[Chorus]\
So I hope I learn to get over myself\
Stop tryin' to be somebody else\
So we can love each other for free\
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me\
\
[Verse 2]\
Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?\
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?\
In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to\
'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true\
[Pre-Chorus]\
You better believe for you, I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)\
High tides (High tides, high tides)\
'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
So I hope I learn to get over myself\
Stop tryin' to be somebody else\
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free\
Everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me\
\
[Bridge]\
Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get\
You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left\
Oh, I hope in time (Hope in time)\
We both will find peace of mind (We both find)\
Sometimes, the road less travelled is a road best left behind\
\
[Chorus]\
Well, I hope I learn to get over myself\
Stop tryin' to be somebody else\
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free, yeah\
'Cause everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me\
\
[Refrain]\
You better believe I'm tryin' (Tryin', tryin')\
To keep climbin' (Climbin', climbin')\
But the higher we climb, feels like we're both none the wiser\
[Outro]\
The only regret I have\
I wish that it was just at a different time\
A most turbulent period of my life\
Why would I put that on you?\
That's just, like, a very heavy thing to have to talk about\
But because of that period of time\
Even though it was so much fun\
\
\
\
'Love in the Dark'\
\
\
This is never-endin', we have been here before\
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Please, stay where you are\
Don't come any closer\
Don't try to change my mind\
I'm being cruel to be kind\
\
[Chorus]\
I can't love you in the dark\
It feels like we're oceans apart\
There is so much space between us\
Baby, we're already defeated\
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah\
Everything changed me\
\
[Verse 2]\
You have given me something that I can't live without\
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt\
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine\
The longer we ignore it all, the more that we will fight\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Please, don't fall apart\
I can't face your breaking heart\
I'm trying to be brave\
Stop asking me to stay\
\
[Chorus]\
I can't love you in the dark\
It feels like we're oceans apart\
There is so much space between us\
Baby, we're already defeated\
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah\
Everything changed me\
\
[Bridge]\
We're not the only ones, I don't regret a thing\
Every word I've said, you know I'll always mean\
It is the world to me that you are in my life\
But I want to live and not just survive\
\
[Chorus]\
That's why I can't love you in the dark\
It feels like we're oceans apart\
There is so much space between us\
Baby, we're already defeated\
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah\
\
\
\
'My Little Love'\
\
\
When you look at me so full of my emotions\
I'm findin' it hard to be here sincerely\
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely\
[Bridge: Adele & Angelo Adkins]\
Tell me you love me\
I love you a million percent\
\
[Verse 2]\
I don't recognise myself in the coldness of the daylight\
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies\
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty\
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save m\uc0\u1077 \
\
[Bridge: Angelo Adkins & Adele]\
Oi, I feel like you don't love me\
Why do you feel lik\uc0\u1077  that?\
Do you like me?\
You know mummy doesn't like anyone else like I like you, right?\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm holdin' on (Barely)\
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)\
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)\
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)\
[Bridge: Adele & Angelo Adkins]\
Mummy's been having a lot of big feelings recently\
Like how?\
Just, like, hang on, my fingers are trapped\
Like, um, I feel a bit confused\
Why?\
I don't know\
And I feel like I don't really know what I'm doing\
Oh, at all?\
At all\
And that would make me go...\
\
[Verse 3]\
My little love\
Tell me, do you feel the way my past aches?\
When you lay on me, can you hear the way my heart breaks?\
I wanted you to have everything I never had\
I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad\
[Bridge: Adele & Angelo Adkins]\
I love your dad 'cause he gave you to me\
You're half me and you're half daddy\
Oh\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm holdin' on (Barely)\
Mama's got a lot to learn (It's heavy)\
I'm holdin' on (Catch me)\
Mama's got a lot to learn (Teach me)\
[Outro]\
I'm having a bad day, I'm having a very anxious day\
I feel very paranoid, I feel very stressed\
Um, I have a hangover, which never helps, but\
I feel like today is the first day since I left him that I feel lonely\
And I never feel lonely, I love being on my own\
I always preferred being on my own than being with people\
And I feel like maybe I've been, like, overcompensating\
And being out and stuff like that to keep my mind off of him\
And I feel like today, I'm home and I wanna be at home\
I just wanna watch TV and curl up in a ball and\
\
\
\
'Hold On'\
\
\
Love will soon come\
Just hold, hold on\
\
[Verse 1]\
Oh, what have I done yet again?\
Have I not learned anything?\
I don't want to live in chaos\
It's like a ride that I want to get off\
It's hard to hold on to who I am\
When I'm stumblin' in the dark for a hand\
I am so tired of battling with myself, with no chance to win\
\
[Chorus]\
(Hold on)\
Let time be patient\
(You are still strong)\
Let pain be gracious\
(Love will soon come)\
Just hold, hold on\
\
[Verse 2]\
I swear to God, I am such a mess\
The harder that I try, I regress\
I'm my own worst enemy\
Right now, I truly hate bein' me\
Every day feels like the road I'm on\
Might just open up and swallow me whole\
How do I feel so mighty small\
When I'm struggling to feel at all?\
[Chorus]\
Just hold on (Hold on)\
Let time be patient\
You are still strong (You are still strong)\
Let pain be gracious (Love will soon come)\
Just hold on (You, just hold on, you, just hold on)\
Hold on (You, just hold on, just hold on)\
\
[Bridge]\
Sometimes, loneliness is the only rest we get\
(Just hold on, just hold on)\
And the emptiness actually lets us forget\
(Just hold on, just hold on)\
Sometimes, forgiveness is easiest in secret\
(Just hold on, just hold on, just hold on, just hold on)\
\
[Chorus]\
So just hold on, ooh\
Let time be patient and (You are still strong)\
Let pain be gracious\
Love will soon come, baby\
If you just hold on\
\
[Outro]\
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on (Hold on)\
Just let time be patient\
'Cause you're still strong, you're still strong (You are still strong)\
Just be gracious\
Love will soon come\
If you just hold on\
(You, just hold on, you, just hold on)\
Just be patient, just be patient (You, just hold on, you, just hold on)\
\
\
\
'Oh My God'\
\
\
Wish that I would let you break my walls\
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall\
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie\
It's what keeps me comin' back even though I'm terrified\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I know that it's wrong\
But I want to have fun\
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah\
I know that it's wrong\
But I want to have fun\
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah\
\
[Chorus]\
Oh, my God, I can't believe it\
Out of all the people in the world\
What is the likelihood of jumping\
Out of my life and into your arms?\
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind\
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right\
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell\
Is a battle that I cannot fight\
[Verse 2]\
I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind\
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind\
I don't have to explain myself to you\
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I know that it's wrong\
But I want to have fun\
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah\
I know that it's wrong\
But I want to have fun\
Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah\
\
[Chorus]\
Oh, my God, I can't believe it\
Out of all the people in the world\
What is the likelihood of jumping\
Out of my life and into your arms?\
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind\
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right\
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell\
Is a battle that I cannot fight\
\
[Bridge]\
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"\
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Oh, Lord)\
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"\
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Don't let me let myself down)\
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"\
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Oh, my God)\
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"\
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)\
[Chorus]\
Oh, my God, I can't believe it\
Out of all the people in the world\
What is the likelihood of jumping\
Out of my life and into your arms?\
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind\
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right\
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell\
When it's a battle that I cannot fight\
\
[Outro]\
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"\
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (I know that it's wrong, but I want to have fun)\
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"\
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (Mmm, yeah, mmm, yeah)\
"Lord, don't let me," I said, "Lord, don't let me"\
I said, "Lord, don't let me, let me down" (I know that it's wrong, but I want to have fun)\

\
'Million Years Ago'\
\
\
I only wanted to have fun\
Learning to fly, learning to run\
I let my heart decide the way\
When I was young\
Deep down, I must have always known\
That this would be inevitable\
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay\
And bare my soul\
\
[Chorus]\
I know I'm not the only one\
Who regrets the things they've done\
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me\
Who can't stand the reflection that they see\
I wish I could live a little more\
Look up to the sky, not just the floor\
I feel like my life is flashing by\
And all I can do is watch and cry\
I miss the air, I miss my friends\
I miss my mother, I miss it when\
Life was a party to be thrown\
But that was a million years ago\
[Verse 2]\
When I walk around all of the streets\
Where I grew up and found my feet\
They can't look me in the eye\
It's like they're scared of me\
I try to think of things to say\
Like a joke or a memory\
But they don't recognize me now\
In the light of day\
\
[Chorus]\
I know I'm not the only one\
Who regrets the things they've done\
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me\
Who never became who they thought they'd be\
I wish I could live a little more\
Look up to the sky, not just the floor\
I feel like my life is flashing by\
And all I can do is watch and cry\
I miss the air, I miss my friends\
I miss my mother, I miss it when\
Life was a party to be thrown\
But that was a million years ago\

'Turning Tables'\
\
\
God only knows what we're fighting for\
All that I say, you always say more\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I can't keep up with your turning tables\
Under your thumb, I can't breathe\
\
[Chorus]\
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me\
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me\
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me\
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables\
To turning tables\
\
[Verse 2]\
Under haunted skies, I see you, ooh\
Where love is lost, your ghost is found\
I braved a hundred storms to leave you\
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I can't keep up with your turning tables\
Under your thumb, I can't breathe\
[Chorus]\
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me\
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me\
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me\
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables\
Turning tables\
\
[Bridge]\
Next time, I'll be braver\
I'll be my own saviour\
When the thunder calls for me\
Next time, I'll be braver\
I'll be my own saviour\
Standing on my own two feet\
\
[Chorus]\
I won't let you close enough to hurt me\
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me\
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me\
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables\
To turning tables\

'I Miss You'\
\
\
Treat me soft but touch me cruel\
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby\
Bring the floor up to my knees\
Let me fall into your gravity\
Then kiss me back to life to see\
Your body standing over me\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Baby, don't let the lights go down\
Baby, don't let the lights go down\
Baby, don't let the lights go down\
Lights go down, lights go down\
Lights go down, lights go down\
Down, down, down\
\
[Chorus]\
I miss you when the lights go out\
It illuminates all of my doubts\
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go\
Baby, give me light\
I miss you when the lights go out\
It illuminates all of my doubts\
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go\
Baby, give me light\
[Verse 2]\
I love the way your body moves\
Towards me from across the room\
Brushing past my every groove\
No one has me like you do, baby\
Bring your heart, I'll bring my soul\
But be delicate with my ego\
I wanna step into your great unknown\
With you and me setting the tone\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Baby, don't let the lights go down\
Baby, don't let the lights go down\
Baby, don't let the lights go down\
Lights go down, lights go down\
Lights go down, lights go down\
Down, down, down\
\
[Chorus]\
I miss you when the lights go out\
It illuminates all of my doubts\
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go\
Baby, give me light\
I miss you when the lights go out\
It illuminates all of my doubts\
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go\
Baby, give me light\
[Bridge]\
We play so dirty in the dark\
'Cause we are living worlds apart\
It only makes it harder, baby\
It only makes it harder, baby\
Harder, baby, harder, baby\
\
[Chorus]\
I miss you when the lights go out\
It illuminates all of my doubts\
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go\
Baby, give me light\
I miss you when the lights go out\
It illuminates all of my doubts\
Pull me in, hold me tight, don't let go\
Baby, give me light\

I miss you, I miss you\
I miss you, I miss you\

'Strangers By Nature'\
\
\
Every anniversary, I'll pay respects and say I'm sorry\
For they never stood a chance as if they could\
When no one knows what it's like to be us\
\
[Verse 2]\
I've never seen the sky this colour before\
It's like I'm noticin' everythin' a little bit more\
Now that all the dust has settled\
I rebut all my rebuttals\
No one knows what it's lik\uc0\u1077  to be us\
\
[Chorus]\
Strangers by nature\
Strang\uc0\u1077 rs by nature\

'Love Is A Game'\
\
\
It's so sad how incapable of learning to grow I am\
My heart speaks in puzzle and codes\
I've been trying my whole life to solve\
God only knows how I've cried\
I can't take another defeat\
A next time would be the ending of me\
Now that I see\
\
[Chorus]\
That love is a game for fools to play\
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)\
To self-inflict that pain\
Love is a game for fools to play\
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)\
To self-inflict that pain\
\
[Verse 2]\
How unbelievable (Unbelievable)\
Of me to fall for the lies that I tell (Lies I tell)\
The dream that I sell (Dream I sell)\
When heartache, it's inevitable (And unbearable)\
But I'm no good at doing it well\
Not that I care (I don't care)\
Why should anything about it be fair?\
[Chorus]\
When love is a game for fools to play\
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)\
To self-inflict that pain\
Love is a game for fools to play\
And I ain't fooling again (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)\
To self-inflict that pain\
\
[Bridge]\
No amount of love\
Can keep me satisfied (Satisfied, satisfied)\
I can't keep up (Can't keep up, can't keep up)\
When I keep changing my mind (Change my mind, change my mind)\
The feelings flood me to the heights of no compromise\
\
[Chorus]\
Love is a game for fools to play\
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)\
To self-inflict that pain\
Love is a game for fools to play\
And I ain't fooling (Fooling), what a cruel thing (Cruel thing)\
To self-inflict that pain\
\

Oh, you know I'd do it all again\
I love it now like I loved it then\
I'm a fool for them\

\
'Remedy'\
\
\
Right before my eyes, I saw my heart, it came to life\
This ain't easy, it's not meant to be, every story has its scars\
\
[Chorus]\
But when the pain cuts you deep\
When the night keeps you from sleeping\
Just look and you will see\
That I will be your remedy\
When the world seems so cruel\
And your heart makes you feel like a fool\
I promise you will see\
That I will be, I will be your remedy\
\
[Verse 2]\
No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you\
Come whatever, I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through\
Your love, it is my truth, and I will always love you\
Love you, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
When the pain cuts you deep\
When the night keeps you from sleeping\
Just look and you will see\
That I will be your remedy\
When the world seems so cruel\
And your heart makes you feel like a fool\
I promise you will see\
That I will be, I will be your remedy\
Oh, oh, when the pain cuts you deep\
When the night keeps you from sleeping\
Just look and you will see\
That I will be, I will be\
When the world seems so cruel\
And your heart makes you feel like a fool\
I promise you will see\
That I will be, I will be\

'Woman Like Me'\
\
\
Don\'92t think you quite understand who you have on your hands\
How can you not see just how good for you I am?\
I know that you've been hurt before\
That's why you feel so insecure\
I begged you to let me in \'92cause I only want to be the cure\
If you don't choose to grow, we ain't ever gonna know\
Just how good this could be\
I really hoped that this would go somewhere\
\
[Chorus]\
Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?\
You ain't never had, ain't never had a woman like me\
It is so sad a man lik\uc0\u1077  you could be so lazy\
Consistency is the gift to giv\uc0\u1077  for free and it is key\
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me\
\
[Verse 2]\
All you do is complain about decisions you make\
How can I help lift you if you refuse to activate the life that you truly want?\
I know it's hard, but it's not\
We come from the same place, but you will never give it up\
It's where they make you feel powerful\
That\'92s why you think I make you feel small\
But that\'92s your projection, it's not my rejection\
I put my heart on the line for the very first time\
Because you asked me to and now you\'92ve gone and changed your mind\
But lovin' you was a breakthrough\
I saw what my heart can really do\
Now some other man will get the love I had for you\
'Cause you don't care, oh\
[Chorus]\
Complacency is the worst trait to have, are you crazy?\
You ain\'92t never had, ain't never had a woman like me\
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy\
Consistency is the gift to give for free and it is key\
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me\
\
[Outro]\
A woman like me (One more time)\
Complacency (Woman like me), is the worst trait to have (Woman like me)\
Are you crazy? (Woman like me)\
You ain't never had, ain't never had a woman like me (Woman like me)\

'One and Only'\
\
\
Lose myself in time\
Just thinking of your face\
God only knows\
Why it's taken me so long\
To let my doubts go\
You're the only one that I want\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I don't know why I'm scared\
I've been here before\
Every feeling, every word\
I've imagined it all\
You'll never know if you never try\
To forgive your past and simply be mine\
\
[Chorus]\
I dare you to let me be your\
Your one and only\
Promise I'm worthy\
To hold in your arms\
So come on and give me the chance\
To prove I am the one who can\
Walk that mile\
Until the end starts\
[Verse 2]\
Have I been on your mind?\
You hang on every word I say\
Lose yourself in time\
At the mention of my name?\
Will I ever know\
How it feels to hold you close?\
And have you tell me\
Whichever road I choose, you'll go\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I don't know why I'm scared\
'Cause I've been here before\
Every feeling, every word\
I've imagined it all\
You'll never know if you never try\
To forgive your past and simply be mine\
\
[Chorus]\
I dare you to let me be your\
Your one and only\
I promise I'm worthy, mmm\
To hold in your arms\
So come on and give me the chance\
To prove I am the one who can\
Walk that mile\
Until the end starts\
[Bridge]\
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart\
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart\
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart\
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart\
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart\
(Nobody's perfect, trust me I've learned it) I know it ain't easy giving up your heart\
\
[Chorus]\
So, I dare you to let me be your\
Your one and only\
I promise I'm worthy\
To hold in your arms\
So come on and give me the chance\
To prove I am the one who can\
Walk that mile\
Until the end starts\

Come on and give me the chance\
To prove I am the one who can\

'Cry Your Heart Out'\
\
\
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face\
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace\
\
[Verse 1]\
When I walk in a room, I'm invisible, I feel like a ghost\
All my friends keep on tellin' me that this feeling won't last, mmm\
I can't get no relief, I'm so tired of myself, I swear I'm dead in the eyes\
I have nothin' to feel no more, I can't even cry\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
When will I begin to feel like me again?\
I'm hanging by a thread\
My skin's paper-thin, I can't stop wavering\
I've never been more scared\
\
[Chorus]\
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face\
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace\
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face\
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace\
\
[Verse 2]\
When I wake up, I'm afraid of the idea of facin' the day\
I would rather stay home on my own, drink it all away\
Please stop callin' me, it's exhausting, there's really nothin' left to say\
I created this storm, it's only fair I have to sit in its rain\
[Pre-Chorus]\
When will I begin to feel like me again?\
I'm hanging by a thread\
My skin's paper-thin, I can't stop wavering\
I've never been more scared\
\
[Chorus]\
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face\
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace\
Cry your heart out, it'll clean your face\
When you're in doubt, go at your own pace\
\
[Bridge]\
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)\
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)\
All love is devout, no feeling is a waste\
But give it to yourself now before it's too late\
In the end, it's just you, stop drowning in wait\
Your love is useless without it\
\
[Chorus]\
\
\
\
'Rumour Has It'\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
She, she ain't real\
She ain't gon' be able to love you like I will\
She is a stranger\
You and I have history, or don't you remember?\
Sure, she's got it all\
But baby, is that really what you want?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds\
She made a fool out of you and, boy, she's bringin' you down\
She made your heart melt, but you're cold to the core\
Now rumour has it, she ain't got your love anymore\
\
[Chorus]\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
[Verse 2]\
She is half your age\
But I'm guessin' that's the reason that you strayed\
I heard you've been missin' me\
You've been tellin' people things you shouldn't be\
Like when we creep out when she ain't around\
Haven't you heard the rumours? (Bless your soul)\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds\
You made a fool out of me and, boy, you're bringin' me down\
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core\
But rumour has it, I'm the one you're leaving her for\
\
[Chorus]\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
\
[Bridge]\
All of these words whispered in my ear\
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear\
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it\
People say crazy things\
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it\
Just 'cause you heard it\
[Chorus]\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\
Rumour has it (Rumour)\

'Don\'92t You Remember'\
\
\
No final kiss to seal any sins\
I had no idea of the state we were in\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness\
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head\
\
[Chorus]\
But don't you remember?\
Don't you remember?\
The reason you loved me before\
Baby, please remember me once more\
\
[Verse 2]\
When was the last time that you thought of me?\
Or have you completely erased me from your memory?\
I often think about where I went wrong\
The more I do, the less I know\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
But I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness\
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head\
[Chorus]\
But don't you remember?\
Don't you remember?\
The reason you loved me before\
Baby, please remember me once more\
\
[Bridge]\
Gave you the space so you could breathe\
I kept my distance so you would be free\
In hope that you'd find the missing piece\
To bring you back to me\

Why don't you remember?\
Don't you remember?\
The reason you loved me before\
Baby, please remember me once more\

Memories are fresh\
'Round my hometown\
Ooh, the people I've met\
Are the wonders of my world\

\
[Verse 2]\
I like it in the city\
When the air is so thick and opaque\
I love it to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades\
I like it in the city when two worlds collide\
You get the people and the government\
Everybody taking different sides\

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit\
Shows that we are united\
Shows that we ain't gonna take it\
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit\

'Can I Get It'\
\
\
I will beg and I'll steal, I will borrow\
If I can make, if I can make your heart my home\
Throw me to the water\
I don't care how deep or shallow\
Because my heart can pound like thunder\
And your love, and your love can set me free\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Oh, I have promised I will love you 'til the end of time\
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly, and divine\
I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme\
All I want is for you to be mine, mine\

So can I get it right now? Mmm\
Can I get it right now? (Can I get it here?)\
Can I get it right now?\
Can I get it right now?\
Let me, let me just come and get it\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
Can I get it?\
[Verse 2]\
You tease me with your control\
Because I long to live under your spell\
And without your love, I'm hollow\
I won't make it, I won't make it on my own\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I have promised I will love you 'til the end of time (End of time)\
Through it all, the good, the bad, the ugly and divine (So divine)\
I will be the melody, the rhythm, and your rhyme (Mmm)\
All I want is for you to be mine, mine\

So can I get it right now? Mmm\
Can I get it right now? (Mmm)\

'River Lea'\
\
\
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and manmade\
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake\
Sometimes, I feel lonely in the arms of your touch\
But I know that's just me 'cause nothing ever is enough\
When I was a child, I grew up by the River Lea\
There was something in the water, now that something's in me\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Oh, I can't go back\
But the reeds are growing out of my fingertips\
I can't go back to the river\
\
[Chorus]\
But it's in my roots, in my veins\
In my blood and I stain\
Every heart that I use to heal the pain\
Oh, it's in my roots, in my veins\
In my blood and I stain\
Every heart that I use to heal the pain\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\
[Verse 2]\
I should probably tell you now before it's way too late\
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face\
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance\
But, I would rather say it now in case I never get the chance\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
No, I can't go back\
But the reeds are growing out of my fingertips\
I can't go back to the river\
\
[Chorus]\
But it's in my roots, in my veins\
In my blood and I stain\
Every heart that I use to heal the pain\
Oh, it's in my roots, in my veins\
In my blood and I stain\
Every heart that I use to heal the pain\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea\

'Sweetest Devotion'\
\
\
With your loving, there ain't nothing that I can't adore\
The way I'm running with you, honey\
Means we can break every law\
I find it funny that you're the only one I never looked for\
There is something in your loving that tears down my walls\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now\
I'm heading straight for you\
You will only be eternally\
The one that I belong to\
\
[Chorus]\
The sweetest devotion\
Hit me like an explosion\
All of my life, I've been frozen\
The sweetest devotion I know\
\
[Verse 2]\
I'll forever be whatever you want me to be\
I'll go under and all over for your clarity\
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home\
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all along\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now\
I'm heading straight for you\
You will only be eternally\
The one that I belong to\
\
[Chorus]\
The sweetest devotion\
Hit me like an explosion\
All of my life, I've been frozen\
The sweetest devotion I know\
\
[Bridge]\
I've been looking for you, baby\
In every face that I've ever known\
And there is something 'bout the way you love me\
That finally feels like home\
You're my light, you're my darkness\
You're the right kind of madness\
You're my hope, you're my despair\
You're my scope of everything, everywhere\
\
[Chorus]\
The sweetest devotion\
Hit me like an explosion\
All of my life, I've been frozen\
The sweetest devotion I know\
[Outro]\
Sweetest, it's the sweetest\
Sweetest, it's the sweetest\
\
\
\
'He Won\'92t Go'\
\
\
Or at least the sides I thought I knew\
I can't bear this time\
It drags on as I lose my mind\
Reminded by things I find\
Like notes and clothes you left behind\
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done\
I won't rise until this battle's won\
My dignity's become undone\
\
[Chorus]\
But I won't go\
I can't do it on my own\
If this ain't love, then what is?\
I'm willing to take the risk\
I won't go\
I can't do it on my own\
If this ain't love, then what is?\
I'm willing to take the risk\
\
[Verse 2]\
So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this ride\
What if I lose my heart and fail the climb?\
I won't forgive me if I give up trying\
I heard his voice today\
I didn't know a single word he said\
Not one resemblance to the man I met\
Just a vague and broken boy instead\
[Chorus]\
But I won't go\
I can't do it on my own\
If this ain't love, then what is?\
I'm willing to take the risk\
I won't go\
I can't do it on my own\
If this ain't love, then what is?\
I, I'm willing to take the risk\
\
[Bridge]\
There will be times we'll try and give it up\
Bursting at the seams, no doubt\
We'll almost fall apart then burn the pieces\
To watch them turn to dust\
But nothing will ever taint us\
\
[Chorus]\
I won't go\
I can't do it on my own\
If this ain't love, then what is?\
I'm willing to take the risk\
I won't go\
I can't do it on my own\
If this ain't love, then what is?\
I, I'm willing to take the risk\
[Verse 3]\
Will he, will he still remember me?\
Will he still love me even when he's free?\
Or will he go back to the place where he\
Will choose the poison over me?\
When we spoke yesterday\
He said to hold my breath and sit and wait\
"I'll be home so soon, I won't be late"\
\
[Chorus]\
He won't go\
He can't do it on his own\
If this ain't love, then what is?\
He's willing to take the risk\
So I won't go\
He can't do it on his own\
If this ain't love, then what is?\
I'm willing to take the risk\
'Cause he won't go\
He can't do it on his own\
If this ain't love, then what is?\
We're willing to take the risk\
I won't go\
I can't do it on my own\
\
\
\
'Lovesong'\
\
\
Whenever I'm alone with you\
You make me feel like I am whole again\
\
[Verse 2]\
Whenever I'm alone with you\
You make me feel like I am young again\
Whenever I'm alone with you\
You make me feel like I am fun again\
\
[Chorus]\
However far away, I will always love you\
However long I stay, I will always love you\
Whatever words I say, I will always love you\
I will always love you\
\
[Verse 3]\
Whenever I'm alone with you\
You make me feel like I am free again\
Whenever I'm alone with you\
You make me feel like I am clean again\
\
[Chorus]\
However far away, I will always love you\
However long I stay, I will always love you\
Whatever words I say, I will always love you\
I will always love you\
However far away, I will always love you\
However long I stay, I will always love you\
Whatever words I say, I will always love you\
I'll always love you\
[Outro]\
I'll always love you\
\
\
\
'Daydreamer'\
\
\
Soaking up the sun\
He is a real lover\
Of making up the past\
And feeling up his girl\
Like he's never felt her figure before\
\
[Verse 2]\
A jaw dropper\
Looks good when he walks\
Is the subject of their talk\
He would be hard to chase\
But good to catch\
And he could change the world\
With his hands behind his back, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
You can find him sitting on your doorstep\
Waiting for a surprise\
And he will feel like he's been there for hours\
And you can tell that he'll be there for life\
\
[Verse 3]\
Daydreamer\
With eyes that make you melt\
He lends his coat for shelter\
Plus he's there for you\
When he shouldn't be\
But he stays all the same\
Waits for you\
Then sees you through\
[Bridge]\
There's no way I could describe him\
What I've said is just what I'm hoping for\
\
[Chorus]\
But I will find him sitting on my doorstep\
Waiting for a surprise\
And he will feel like he's been there for hours\
\
\
\
'Can\'92t Let Go'\
\
\
How did it slow down? I go round and around\
Thinking about it all the time\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I gave you heaven on a platter, baby\
I gave you everything you never gave me\
I never lied and I never faked it\
Only wanted for you to save me\
This love, it ain't over yet\
There's too much that I haven't said\
\
[Chorus]\
Did you find the note that I wrote?\
I hid it in the seam of your coat\
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat\
Do you even know that I can't let go?\
\
[Verse 2]\
Why were you so cold? Let the truth be told\
Tell me, was it all for the thrill?\
What was I thinking? I gave you everything\
But you still went for the kill\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I gave you heaven on a platter, baby\
I gave you everything you never gave me\
I never lied and I never faked it\
Only wanted for you to save me\
\
[Chorus]\
Did you find the note that I wrote?\
I hid it in the seam of your coat\
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat\
Do you even know that I can't let go?\
\
[Bridge]\
Ooh, sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark\
Ooh, I thought I'd die in your arms\
\
[Chorus]\
Did you find the note that I wrote?\
I hid it in the seam of your coat\
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat\
Do you even know that I can't let go?\
\
\
\
\
'Melt My Heart to Stone'\
\
\
I find myself repeating like a broken tune\
And I'm forever excusing your intentions\
Then, I give in to my pretendings\
Which forgive you each time\
Without me knowing\
They melt my heart to stone\
\
[Chorus 1]\
And I hear your words that I made up\
You say my name like there could be an us\
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love\
I'm the only one in love\
\
[Verse 2]\
Each and every time I turn around to leave\
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed\
So, desperately, I try to link it with my head\
But instead, I fall back to my knees\
As you tear your way right through me\
I forgive you once again\
Without me knowing\
You've burnt my heart to stone\
[Chorus 1]\
And I hear your words that I made up\
You say my name like there could be an us\
I best tidy up my head, I'm the only one in love\
I'm the only one in love\
\
[Bridge]\
Why do you steal my hand\
Whenever I'm standing my own ground?\
You build me up and leave me there\
\
[Chorus 2]\
Well, I hear your words you made up\
I say your name like there should be an us\
\
\
\
'Take It All'\
\
\
Didn't I do it right? Did I let you down?\
Maybe you got too used to, well, having me around\
Still, how can you walk away from all my tears?\
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here\
\
[Chorus]\
But go on and take it (Take it)\
Take it all with you\
Don't look back (Don't look back)\
At this crumbling fool\
Just take it all with my love\
Take it all with my love\
\
[Verse 2]\
Maybe I should leave to help you see\
Nothing gets better than this\
And this is everything we need\
So is it over? Is this really it?\
You're giving up so easily\
I thought you loved me more than this\
\
[Chorus]\
But go on, go on and take it (Take it)\
Take it all with you\
Don't look back (Don't look back)\
At this crumbling fool\
Just take it all with my love\
Take it all with my love\
[Bridge]\
I will change if I must\
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust\
Oh, if only, if only you knew\
That everything I do is for you\
\
[Chorus]\
But go on, go on and take it (Take it)\
Take it all with you\
Don't look back (Don't look back)\
At this crumbling fool\
Just take it (Take it)\
Take it all with you\
Don't look back (Don't look back)\
At this crumbling fool\
Just take it all with my love\
\
\
\
'Why Do You Love Me'\
\
\
Why do you love me, do you love me?\
Why do you love me?\
Why do you love me, do you love me?\
Why do you love me, do you love me?\
Why do you love me, do you love me?\
Why do you love me?\
\
[Verse 1]\
Why do you love me?\
There must be something in the water\
'Cause, baby, I'm in deeper than I knew\
How do you keep me coming back for more\
After all we've been through?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I can't decide if I should run and hide\
\
[Chorus]\
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands\
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand\
Just why I want you to love me\
I want you to love me\
I want you to love me\
I want you to love me\
[Verse 2]\
Who knows why I love you\
It could be something in the air I breathe\
Whatever it is, I depend on it\
And where does the time go?\
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right\
\
[Chorus]\
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands\
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand\
Just why I want you to love me\
I want you to love me\
I want you to love me\
I want you to love me\
\
[Bridge]\
You were a shot in the dark that blew me away\
And you left your mark, and it never will fade\
You've ignited a spark, let the fires away\
Are you ready, ready?\
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours\
You are the peak and art of my universe\
Every piece and part, you were the first\
I am ready, ready\
[Chorus]\
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands\
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand\
Just why I want you to love me\
I want you to love me\
I want you to love me\
I want you\
\
[Chorus]\
It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands\
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand\
Just why I want you to love me\
I want you to love me\
I want you to love me\
I want you to love me\
\
[Outro]\
Why do you love me, do you love me?\
Why do you love me, do you love me?\
\
\
\
'Crazy for You'\
\
\
Sometimes sittin' in the dark, wishin' you were here\
Turns me crazy, but it's you who makes me lose my head\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible\
You drift into my head and\
Turn me into a crumblin' fool\
\
[Chorus]\
Tell me to run and I'll race\
If you want me to stop I'll freeze\
And if you want me gone, I'll leave\
Just hold me closer, baby\
And make me crazy for you\
Crazy for you\
\
[Verse 2]\
Lately with this state I'm in, I can't help myself but spin\
I wish you'd come over, send me spinning closer to you\
My, oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you\
Strips me down bare and gets me into my favourite mood\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away\
But the more I do\
The crazier I turn into\
[Chorus]\
Pacing floors and opening doors\
Hoping you'll walk through\
And save me, boy\
\
\
\
'First Love'\
\
\
Please, wear the face, the one where you smile\
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry\
\
[Chorus]\
Forgive me, first love, but I'm tired\
I need to get away to feel again\
Try to understand why\
Don't get so close to change my mind\
Please wipe that look out of your eyes\
It's bribing me to doubt myself\
Simply, it's tiring\
\
[Verse 2]\
This love has dried up, and stayed behind\
And if I stay, I'll be a lie\
Then choke on words I'd always hide\
Excuse me, first love, but we're through\
I need to taste the kiss from someone new\
Forgive me, first love, but I'm too tired\
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire\
\
[Outro]\
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love\
\
\
\
'I\'92ll Be Waiting'\
\
\
Please forgive me for my sins\
Yes, I swam dirty waters but you pushed me in\
I've seen your face under every sky\
Over every border and on every line\
You know my heart more than I do\
We were the greatest, me and you\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
But we had time against us and miles between us\
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless\
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue\
And I see my future in you\
\
[Chorus]\
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again\
I'll put my hands up\
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you\
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again\
I'll put my hands up\
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you\
\
[Verse 2]\
Let me stay here for just one more night\
Build your walls around me and pull me to the light\
So I can tell you that I was wrong\
I was a child then but now I'm willing to learn\
[Pre-Chorus]\
But we had time against us and miles between us\
The heavens cried, I know I left you speechless\
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue\
And I see my future in you\
\
[Chorus]\
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again\
I'll put my hands up\
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you\
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again\
I'll put my hands up\
I'll be somebody different, I'll be better to you\
\
[Bridge]\
Time against us (Time against us), miles between us (Miles between us)\
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless\
Time against us (Time against us), miles between us (Miles between us)\
Heavens cried, I know I left you speechless\
I know I left you speechless\
I'll be waiting\
\
[Chorus]\
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again\
I'll put my hands up\
I'll do everything different, I'll be better to you\
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again\

\
'Wild Wild West'\
\
\
So much so\uc0\u8197 that I got hitched in a\u8197 big white dress\
But all it did was make me so sad and stressed\
And so I got soaked in the wild wild west\
I was gallivanting in the silhouettes\
That's when I, I met a jingler in the, in the wild west\
While he was sparrow-catching in the wilderness\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
(Ah-ooh)\
Don't waste your time when I've got a (Ah-ooh) backbone of steel\
(Ah-ooh)\
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a (Ah-ooh) look that will kill\
(Ah-ooh)\
Don't waste your time when I've got a (Ah-ooh) backbone of steel\
(Ah-ooh)\
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill ya\
\
[Chorus]\
From LA to San Francisco\
I lost my mind in San Bernardino\
Even Chula Vista and Modesto\
I broke my heart in San Diego\
[Verse 2]\
Now I'm cutting shines in the wild wild west\
I had to bed my man down to save myself\
That's when I got churched in the, in the wild west\
Not that I care, I find God so hard to impress\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
(Ah-ooh)\
Don't waste your time when I've got a (Ah-ooh) backbone of steel\
(Don't waste your time)\
(Ah-ooh)\
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a (Ah-ooh) look that will kill\
(I'll shoot you down)\
(Ah-ooh)\
Don't waste your time when I've got a (Ah-ooh) backbone of steel\
(Don't waste your time)\
(Ah-ooh)\
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill ya\
\
[Chorus]\
From LA to San Francisco\
I lost my mind in San Bernardino\
Even Chula Vista and Modesto\
I broke my heart in San Diego\
\
[Bridge]\
Wild in the west (It's so wild)\
It's so wild in the west\
(It's so wild, it's so wild)\
(It's so wild in the west)\
Wild wild west\
[Chorus]\
From LA to San Francisco\
I lost my mind in (I lost my mind) San Bernardino\
(Even Chula) Even Chula Vista and Modesto\
I broke my heart (I broke my heart) in San Diego\
From LA to San Francisco\
I lost my mind in San Bernardino\
\
\
\
'I Found a Boy'\
\
\
I fall short each time, every time he ain't here\
You and your charm creep closer, closer and near\
Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all\
Like a bomb before explosion, ticking by your call\
You're the wiser one, disguised from greed\
And I'm just a child who longs on her knees\
\
[Chorus]\
But I found a boy who I love more\
Than I ever did you before\
So stand beside the river I cried\
And lay yourself down\
Look how you want me now that I don't need you\
\
[Verse 2]\
So you thought that I'd crumble to my knees\
At the first sight of you crawling back to me\
To whisper, "Will you leave your man?"\
'Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me\
I won't stand by you\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause I found a boy who I love more\
Than I ever did you before\
So stand beside the river I cried\
And lay yourself down\
Look how you want me now that I don't need you\
[Bridge]\
I ain't yours for no taking\
You must be mistaken\
I could never look into your eyes\
And settle for wrong and ignore the right\
\
[Chorus]\
When I found a boy who loves me more\
Than you ever did before\
So stand beside the river you cried\
\
\
\
'Lay Me Down'\
\
\
And hold against me, why won't you let it be?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Don't you ever say my love, "open up your heart"\
No I'm not gonna do it standing up\
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me\
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights\
\
[Chorus]\
Lay me down ('til the morning)\
Lay me down (through the night)\
Lay me down (I can fall in)\
Lay me down (Won\'92t you)\
Lay me down (I can baby)\
Lay me down (Someone believe me)\
\
[Verse 2]\
I would never break the rules unless you tell me to\
You can read my mind, be it truth or lies\
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart\
No I'm not gonna do it standing up\
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me\
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights\
[Chorus]\
Lay me down ('til the morning)\
Lay me down (through the night)\
Lay me down (I can fall in)\
Lay me down (Won't you)\
Lay me down (I can baby)\
Lay me down (Someone believe me)\
\
[Bridge]\
Lay down with me\
Lay down with me\
Lay down with me\
Lay down with me\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Words don't come out right when you're right in front of me\
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights\
\
[Chorus]\
Lay me down ('til the morning)\
Lay me down (through the night)\
Lay me down (I can fall in)\
Lay me down (Won't you)\
\
\
\
'Right as Rain'\
\
\
Who wants to be right as rain?\
It's better when something is wrong\
You get excitement in your bones\
And everything you do's a game\
When night comes, and you're on your own\
You can say, "I chose to be alone"\
Who wants to be right as rain?\
It's harder when you're on top\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired\
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned\
So wipe that dirty smile off\
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out\
And now I've had enough of love\
\
[Verse 2]\
Who wants to be riding high\
When you'll just crumble back on down?\
You give up everything you are\
And even then, you don't get far\
They make believe that everything\
Is exactly what it seems\
But at least when you're at your worst\
You know how to feel things\
[Chorus]\
See, when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired\
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned\
So wipe that dirty smile off\
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out\
And now, I've had enough of (love)\
\
[Bridge]\
Go ahead and steal my heart to make me cry again\
'Cause it will never hurt as much it did then\
When we were both right, and no one had blame\
But now, I give up on this endless game\
\
[Verse 3]\
'Cause who wants to be right as rain?\
It's better when something is wrong\
I get excitement in my bones\
Even though everything's a strain\
When night comes, and I'm on my own\
You should know I chose to be alone\
Who wants to be right as rain?\
It's harder when you're on top\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause when hard work don't pay off and I'm tired\
There ain't no room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned\
So wipe that dirty smile off\
We won't be making up, I've cried my heart out\
And now, I've had enough of\'97\
[Outro]\
No room in my bed, as far as I'm concerned\
So wipe that dirty smile off\
\
\
\
'Best for Last'\
\
\
And it's been waitin' for you to open up yours, too\
Baby, come on now, I'm trying to tell you just how\
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally\
Say that it's always been me\
\
[Chorus]\
That's made you feel a way you've never felt before\
And I'm all you need and that you never want more\
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue\
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
You should know that you're just a temporary fix\
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me\
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free\
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me, yeah?\
\
[Verse 2]\
Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest\
It turns out it ain't enough?\
You're still not mentioning love\
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?\
I'm takin' these chances and getting nowhere\
And though I'm trying my hardest, you go back to her\
And I think that I know things may never change\
I'm still hopin' one day I might hear you say\
[Chorus]\
I make you feel a way you've never felt before\
And I'm all you need and that you never want more\
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue\
But you'd save the best for last like I'm the one for you\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
You should know that you're just a temporary fix\
This is not rooted with you, it don't mean that much to me\
You're just a filler in the space that happened to be free\
How dare you think you'd get away with tryin' to play me, yeah?\
\
[Bridge]\
But, despite the truth that I know\
I find it hard to let go and give up on you\
Seems I love the things you do\
Like the meaner you treat me, more eager I am\
To persist with this heartbreak of runnin' around\
And I will do until I'm findin' myself with you\
\
[Chorus]\
And make you feel a way you've never felt before\
And be all you need so that you never want more\
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue\
\
\
\
'Can\'92t Be Together'\
\
\
I may be out of your view, but I can hear you\
I may be out of the room, but I can see you\
I know you still want me, you always will\
And I can guarantee I know just how it feels\
To never be free completely\
Sometimes you just feel so empty\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Like lately when I have been missing you\
And I would still do anything for you\
\
[Chorus]\
But we need to learn how to love who we're loving\
It's hard but we must we've got to let it go\
And turn off the urge to know what could have been\
But I will love you forever\
\
[Verse 2]\
I was far too reckless, I know that now\
Trying to make you jealous made me feel proud\
But now I'm in too deep to climb out\
But know that I live with my doubt, oh-oh\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Like lately when I have been missing you\
And I want to do everything with you\
\
[Chorus]\
But we need to learn how to love who we're loving\
It's hard but we must, we've got to let it go\
And turn off the urge to know what could have been\
But I will love you forever\
\
[Bridge]\
Since we were together everybody's changed\
Our reflections in the mirror no longer look the same\
And we're only just beginning to live the lives we'll make\
But I will always miss you at the end of each day\
\
[Chorus]\
But we need to learn how to love who we're loving\
It's hard but we must, we've got to let it go\
And turn off the urge to know what could have been\
My love, let's learn how to love who we're loving\
It's so hard but we must, we've got to let it go\
And turn off the urge to know what could have been\
But I will love you forever\

'Cold Shoulder'\
\
\
You say it's all in my head\
And the things I think just don't make sense\
So where you been, then? Don't go all coy\
Don't turn it 'round on me like it's my fault\
See, I can see that look in your eyes\
The one that shoots me each and every time (each and every time)\
\
[Chorus]\
You grace me with your cold shoulder\
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her\
You shower me with words made of knives\
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her\
\
[Verse 2]\
These days when I see you\
You make it look like I'm see-through\
Do tell me why you waste our time\
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied\
You know I know just how you feel\
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when\
\
[Chorus]\
You grace me with your cold shoulder\
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her\
You shower me with words made of knives\
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her\
[Bridge]\
Time and time again, I play the role of fool\
(Just for you)\
And even in the daylight when you think that\
(I don't see you)\
I try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find\
Though I do know how you play\
\
[Chorus]\
You grace me with your cold shoulder\
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her\
You shower me with words made of knives\
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her\
You grace me with your cold shoulder\
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her\

'Hello'\

To go over everything\
They say that time's supposed to heal ya\
But I ain't done much healin'\
Hello, can you hear me?\
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be\
When we were younger and free\
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
There's such a difference between us\
And a million miles\
[Chorus]\
Hello from the other side\
I must've called a thousand times\
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done\
But when I call, you never seem to be home\
Hello from the outside\
At least, I can say that I've tried\
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart\
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore\
\
[Verse 2]\
Hello, how are you?\
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry\
I hope that you're well\
Did you ever make it out of that town\
Where nothing ever happened?\
[Pre-Chorus]\
It's no secret that the both of us\
Are running out of time\
[Chorus]\
So hello from the other side (Other side)\
I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)\
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done\
But when I call, you never seem to be home\
Hello from the outside (Outside)\

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart\

'Easy On Me'\
\
\
I know there is hope in these waters\
But I can't bring myself to swim\
When I am drowning in this silence\
Baby, let me in\
[Chorus]\
Go easy on me, baby\
I was still a child\
Didn't get the chance to\
Feel the world around me\
I had no time to choose what I chose to do\
So go easy on me\
\
[Verse 2]\
There ain't no room for things to change\
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways\
You can't deny how hard I've tried\
I changed who I was to put you both first\
But now I give up\
[Chorus]\
Go easy on m\uc0\u1077 , baby\
I was still a child\
Didn't get the chance to\
Feel th\uc0\u1077  world around me\
Had no time to choose what I chose to do\
So go easy on me\
[Bridge]\
I had good intentions\
And the highest hopes\
But I know right now\
It probably doesn't even show\

Go easy on me, baby\
I was still a child\
I didn't get the chance to\
Feel the world around me\

'Someone Like You'\
\
\
I heard that your dreams came true\
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you\
Old friend, why are you so shy?\
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited\
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it\
I had hoped you'd see my face\
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over\
\
[Chorus]\
Never mind, I'll find someone like you\
I wish nothing but the best for you, too\
Don't forget me, I beg\
I remember you said\
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead\
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead\
\
[Verse 2]\
You know how the time flies\
Only yesterday was the time of our lives\
We were born and raised in a summer haze\
Bound by the surprise of our glory days\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited\
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it\
I had hoped you'd see my face\
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over\
\
[Chorus]\
Never mind, I'll find someone like you\
I wish nothing but the best for you, too\
Don't forget me, I beg\
I remember you said\
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead\
\
[Bridge]\
Nothing compares, no worries or cares\
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made\
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?\
\
[Breakdown]\
Never mind, I'll find someone like you\
I wish nothing but the best for you\
Don't forget me, I beg\
I remember you said\
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead\

'Greatest Love of All'\
\
\
Show them all the beauty they possess inside\
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier\
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be\
Everybody's searching for a hero\
People need someone to look up to\
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs\
A lonely place to be\
And so I learned to depend on me\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I decided long ago\
Never to walk in anyone's shadows\
If I fail, if I succeed\
At least I'll live as I believe\
No matter what they take from me\
They can't take away my dignity\
\
[Chorus]\
Because the greatest love of all\
Is happening to me\
I found the greatest love of all\
Inside of me\
The greatest love of all\
Is easy to achieve\
Learning to love yourself\
It is the greatest love of all\

A day to give\
The best of me\
I'm only one\
But not alone\

I rise and fall\
Yet through it all\
This much remains\

'Where Do Broken Hearts Go'\

\
You see, I haven't been the same\
Since that cold November day\
We said we needed space\
But all we found was an empty place\
And the only things I learned\
Is that I need you desperately\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
So here I am\
And can you please tell me, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
Where do broken hearts go?\
Can they find their way home\
Back to the open arms\
Of a love that's waiting there?\
And if somebody loves you\
Won't they always love you?\
I look in your eyes\
And I know that you still care, for me\
Ooh, baby\
\
[Verse 2]\
I've been around enough to know\
That dreams don't turn to gold\
And that there is no easy way\
No, you just can't run away\
And what we have is so much more\
Than we ever had before\
And no matter how I try\
You're always on my mind\

'All at Once'\
\
\
You're not coming back\
And it finally hit me all at once\
All at once\
I started counting teardrops and at least a million fell\
My eyes began to swell\
And all my dreams were shattered all at once\

Ever since I met you\
You're the only love I've known\
And I can't forget you\
Though I must face it all alone\
\
[Chorus]\
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea\
Wishing you'd come back to me\
And that's all that matters now\
All at once, I'm drifting on a lonely sea\
Holding on to memories\
And it hurts me more than you know\
So much more than it shows\
All at once\

'Who Would Imagine a King'\
\
\
And you could grow up to be anything\
But who would imagine a king?\
A shepherd or teacher is what you could be\
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea\
Or maybe a carpenter building things\
But who would imagine a king?\
It was so clear when the wise men arrived\
And the angels were singing your name\
That the world would be different cause you were alive\
That's why heaven stood still to proclaim\
\
[Bridge]\
One day an angel said quietly\
That soon he would bring something special to me\
And of all of the wonderful gifts he could bring\
\
[Outro]\
Who would imagine?\
Who could imagine?\
Who would imagine a king?\

I would really take you back\
Let you back in my heart one more time? Oh, no, no\

Yo, yo, my men and my women\
Don't forget about the deen\
Sirat al-Mustaqeem\
Yo, it's about a thing, uh, yo, yo\
If ya feel real good wave your hands in the air\
And lick two shots in the atmosphere!\
(Put them up, put them up)\

\
[Verse 1]\
It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend\
The one you let hit it and never called you again\
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?\
You act like you ain't hear him then give him a little trim\
To begin, how you think you're really gon' pretend\
Like you wasn't down and you called him again?\
Plus, when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him\
If you did it then, then you'd probably fuck again\
Talking out your neck, sayin' you're a Christian\
A Muslim, sleeping with the jinn\
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in\
Who you gon' tell when the repercussions spin?\
Showing off your ass 'cause you're thinking it's a trend\
Girlfriend, let me break it down for you again\
You know I only say it 'cause I'm truly genuine\
Don't be a hard rock when you really are a gem\
Baby girl, respect is just a minimum\
Niggas fucked up and you still defending 'em\
Now, Lauryn is only human\
Don't think I haven't been through the same predicament\
Let it sit inside your head like a million women in Philly, Penn\
It's silly when girls sell their souls because it's in\
Look at where you be in, hair weaves like Europeans\
Fake nails done by Koreans\
Come again\
(A win win, come again\
A win win, come again)\

The second verse is dedicated to the men\
More concerned with his rims and his Timbs than his women\
Him and his men come in the club like hooligans\
Don't care who they offend, poppin' yang (like you got yen!)\
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by they waist men\
Cristal by the case men, still in they mother's basement\
The pretty face men claiming that they did a bid men\
Need to take care of they three or four kids\
And they face a court case when the child support late\
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men\
The sneaky, silent men\
The punk, domestic violence men\
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men\
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?\
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?\
How you gonna win when you ain't right within?\
Uh-uh, come again (Yeah)\

(No! No, no, I don\'92t think so)\

\'93You\'92re too young to be in love, this is silly\
You\'92re infatuated or whatever, you got nice jeans\
You wear fancy Adidas\'94\
I mean, it might be something I don\'92t know\
(It's the difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody)\
Well, you tell me. What\'92s the difference?\
(Okay. You can love anybody but when you\'92re in love with somebody you\'92re looking at it like this\'97you\'92re taking that person for what he or she is no matter what he or she look like or no matter what he or she do)\
(You\'92re crazy! You fall in love, you can fall out of love)\
(You might stop being in love with them but you are not gonna stop loving that person)\
(Maybe they ain\'92t never been loved before or been in love before, they don\'92t know what the feeling is to be loved)\

My emancipation don't fit your equation\
I was on the humble, you on every station\
Some wan' play young Lauryn like she dumb\
But remember not a game new under the sun\
Everything you did has already been done\
I know all the tricks from Bricks to Kingston\
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run\
Now understand, L-Boogie, non-violent\
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun\
Can't take a threat to mi new born son\
L been this way since creation\
A groupie call, you fall from temptation\
Now you wanna bawl over separation\
Tarnish my image in the conversation\
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?\
You might win some but you just lost one\

Now, now, how come your talk turn cold?\
Gained the whole world for the price of your soul\
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control\
Now you're all floss, what a sight to behold\
Wisdom is better than silver and gold\
I was hopeless, now I'm on Hope Road\
Every man wanna act like he's exempt\
Need to get down on his knees and repent\
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment\
Your movement's similar to a serpent\
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?\
Consequence is no coincidence\
Hypocrites always wanna play innocent\
Always want to take it to the full out extent\
Always want to make it seem like good intent\
Never want to face it when it time for punishment\
I know you don't wanna hear my opinion\
There come many paths and you must choose one\
And if you don't change then the rain soon come\
See you might win some, but you just lost one\

[Verse 3]\
Now don't you understand, man, universal law?\
What you throw out comes back to you, star\
Never underestimate those who you scar\
'Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard\
You can't hold God's people back that long\
The chain of Shaitan wasn't made that strong\
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond\
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong\
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song\
And some don't know what they have \'91til it's gone\
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn\
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn\
Now, some might listen and some might shun\
And some may think that they've reached perfection\
If you look closely you'll see what you've become\
'Cause you might win some but you just lost one\

'Everything Is Everything'\

After winter must come spring (Must come spring)\
Change, it comes eventually\
Everything is everything\
What is meant to be will be\
After winter must come spring (Must come)\
Change, it comes eventually\
\
[Verse 1]\
I wrote these words (I wrote these words) for everyone who struggles in their youth\
Who won't accept deception in, instead of what is truth (Gotta know the truth, y'all)\
It seems we lose the game\
Before we even start to play\
Who made these rules? (Who made these rules?)\
We're so confused (We're so confused)\
Easily led astray\
Let me tell ya that...\
\
[Chorus 2]\
Everything is everything\
Everything is everything\
Everything is everything (Everything)\
After winter must come spring\

You can't match this rapper slash actress\
More powerful than two Cleopatras\
Bomb graffiti on the tomb of Nefertiti (Ooh, uh)\

My rhymes is heavy like the mind of sister Betty (El Shabazz!)\
L-Boogie spars with stars and constellations (What?)\
Then came down for a little conversation (Huh)\
Adjacent to the king, fear no human being\
Roll with cherubims to Nassau Coliseum (What?)\
Now hear this mixture, where Hip Hop meets scripture (Uh)\
Develop a negative into a positive picture\

Sometimes it seems we'll touch that dream (Sometimes it seems we'll touch that dream)\
But things come slow or not at all (They come slow, know what I mean?)\
And the ones on top won't make it stop (Ones on top, they won't make it stop)\
So convinced that they might fall\
Let's love ourselves and we can't fail\
To make a better situation (Better situation, uh-uh)\
Tomorrow, our seeds will grow (Tomorrow, our seeds will grow)\
All we need is dedication\
Let me tell ya that\

After winter must come spring\
Everything is everything (Everything is everything)\

When you try to get peace of mind\

He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible\
He says it's impossible, but I know it's possible\

[Verse 1]\
He says there's no me without him\
Please help me forget about him\
He takes all my energy, trapped in my memory\
Constantly holding me, constantly holdin' me\

I need to tell you I'm\
I'm undone because, mm-mm-mm-mm\

'The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill'\
\
\
And life squeezes so tight that I can't breathe\
And every time I've tried to be what someone else has thought of me\
So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve\
\
[Chorus]\
But deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me\
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny\
\
[Verse 2]\
I look at my environment\
And wonder where the fire went\
What happened to everything we used to be\
I hear so many cry for help\
Searching outside of themselves\
Now I know that His strength is within me\
\
[Chorus]\
And deep in my heart, the answer, it was in me\
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny (And deep in my heart)\

Little children, eat your bread\
'Cause it all, all falls down\

[Verse]\
Yo! Y'all can't handle the truth in a courtroom of lies\
Perjures the jurors, witness despised\
Crooked lawyers, false indictments publicized\
It's entertainment, the arraignments, the subpoenas\
High profile gladiators in bloodthirsty arenas\
Enter the Dragon, black-robe crooked-balance\
Souls bought and sold and paroled for thirty talents\
Court reporter catch the circus on the paper\
File it in the system not acknowledged by the Maker\
Swearing by the bible blatantly blasphemous\
Publicly perpetrating that "In God We Trust"\
Cross-examined by a master manipulator\
The faster intimidator receiving the judge's favor\
Deceiving sabers doing injury to their neighbors\
For status, gratis, apparatus and legal waivers\
See the bailiff representing security\
Holding the word of God soliciting perjury\
The prosecution, political prostitution\
The more money you pay, the further away solution\
Legal actors, Babylon's benefactors\
Masquerading as the agency for the clients\
Hypocritical giants, morally non-compliant\
Orally armed to do bodily harm\
Polluted, recruited and suited judicial charm\
And the defense isn't making any sense\
Faking the confidence of escaping the consequence\
That a defendant is depending on the system\
Totally void of judgment purposely made to twist 'em\
Emotional victim blackmailed by the henchmen\
Framed by intentions\
Inventions whereby they lynch men\
Enter the false witness slandering the accused\
Planting the seed openly showing he's being used\
To discredit, edit, headed for the alleged\
Smearing the individual fearing the unsuspected\
Expert witness (the paid authority)\
Made a priority to deceive the majority\
Of disinterested peers, dodging duty for years\
Hating the process, waiting to be returning to their careers\
Do we expect the system made for the elect\
To possibly judge correct? Properly serve and protect?\
Materially corrupt, spiritually amuck\
Oblivious to the cause, prosperously bankrupt\
Blind leading the blind, guilty never defined\
Filthy as swine, a generation purin it's own mind\
Legal extortion, blown out of proportion\
In vein deceit, the truth is obsolete\
Only two positions: victimizer or victim\
Both end up in destruction trusting this crooked system\
Mafia with diplomas keeping us in a coma\
Trying to own a piece of the "American Corona"\
The Revolving Door, insanity every floor\
Skyscraping, paper chasing, what are we working for?\
Empty traditions, reaching social positions\
Teaching ambition to support the family superstition?\
When the Son of Perdition is Commander in Chief\
The standard is Thief; brethren, can we candidly speak?\
Woe to the men, trusted in the chariots dem'\
Leaning on horses, they run their intellectual sources\
Counterfeit wisdom creating the illusion of freedom\
Confusion consumes them\
Every word they speak it turns them outwardly white\
Internally they absent of light\
Trapped in the night and bonded to the Cain of the night\
Under the curse, evil men waxing more worse\
Faxing the first, angelic being cast to the earth\
It's time for rebirth, burnin up the branch and the root\
The empty pursuits of every tree bearing the wrong fruit\
Turn and be healed, let him who stole, no longer steal\
Oh it's real, surrender for Jehovah is real\
How long will you sleep, troubled by the thoughts that YOU keep\
The idols YOU heap, causing the destruction you reap\
Judgment has come, find it and return to the One\
Abandon the flesh, self-interest: Broadway to death\
Pride and the Greed, hide and subdividing the seed\
The knowledge of Good and Evil is what caused us to lie\
Caused us to die, let your emotions be crucified\
Renounce all your thoughts\
Repent and let your mind be re-taught\
You'll find what you sought\
Was based on the deception you bought\
A perception of naught where the majority remains caught\
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die\
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die\
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die\
Loving a lie, not realizing in Adam, all die\

Forgive them, Father, for\

\
[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]\
Beware the false motives of others\
Be careful of those who pretend to be brothers\
And you never suppose it's those who are closest to you\
To you\
They say all the right things to gain their position\
Then use your kindness as their ammunition\
To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do\
Oh\

Forgive them, Father, for\

Give me grief, try to tief off my piece\
Why for you to increase, I must decrease?\
If I treat you kindly, does it mean that I'm weak?\
You hear me speak and think I won't take it to the streets\
I know enough cats that don't turn the other cheek\
But I try to keep it civilized, like Menelik\
And other African czars, observing stars with war scars\
Get yours in this capitalistic system\
So many caught or got bought you can't list them\
How you gon' idolize the missing? To survive is to stay alive in the face of opposition\
Even when they coming, gunning I stand position\
L known the mission since conception\
Let's free the people from deception\
If you looking for the answers, then you gotta ask the questions\
And when I let go, my voice echoes through the ghetto\
Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto\
Why black people always be the ones to settle?\
March through these streets like Soweto, uhh\

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill]\
It took me a little while to discover\
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers\
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves\
A friend once said, and I found to be true\
That everyday people, they lie to God too\
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you?\
\
[Chorus: Lauryn Hill & Shelly Thunder]\
Forgive them, Father, for\
They know not what they do (Forgive them, forgive them)\
Forgive them, Father, for\
They know not what they do (Forgive them, forgive them)\

Uhh, uhh (Like fungus among us)\
Yo, yo (Haha), uh\

[Verse 1]\
Yo, I treat this like my thesis\
Well-written topic, broken down into pieces\
I introduce then produce, words so profuse\
It's abuse how I juice up this beat, like I'm deuce\
Two people both equal like I'm Gemini, rather Simeon\
If I Jimmy on this lock I could pop it, you can't stop it\
Drop it, your whole crew microscopic\
Like particles while I make international articles, and on the cover\
Don't discuss the baby mother (Nah)\
Business, I been in this third LP you can't tell me\
I witness first-handed, I'm candid, you can't stand it\
Respect demanded, and get flown around the planet\
Rock Hard like granite or steel\
People feel Lauryn Hill from New-Ark to Israel\
And this is real, so I keep makin' the street's ballads\
While you lookin' for dressin' to go with your tossed salad\

You can get the money, you can get the power\

Whoever's closest to the line's gonna win it\
You gonna fall trying to ball while my team win the pennant\
I'm about to begin it, for a minute, then run for senate\
Make a slum lord be repentant, give his money to kids to spend it\
And then amend it, every law that ever prevented\
Our survival since our arrival documented in The Bible\
Like Moses and Aaron, things gon' change, it's apparent\
And all the transparent gonna be seen through\
Let God redeem you, keep your deen true, you can get the green too\
Watch out what you cling to, observe how a queen do\
And I remain calm reading the 73rd Psalm\
'Cause with all that\'92s going on I got the world in my palm\

Now I be breaking bread sipping Manischewitz wine\
Pay no mind, party like it's 1999\
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine\
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind\
Now I'ma get the mozzarella like a Rockafeller\
Still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella\
Whether posed in Mirabella in Couture\
Or collecting residuals from off The Score\
I'm making sure I'm with the 144\
I've been here before this ain't a battle, this is war\
Word to Boonie, I make salat like a Sunni\
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community\
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hood-chic\
But it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep\
And even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship\
'Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip\

There's always someone there who'll applaud?\

Why you beef with freaks as my album sales peak? Uhh\
All I wanted was to sell like five hundred\
And be a ghetto superstar since my first album, Blunted\
I used to work at Foot Locker, they fired me: I fronted\
Or I quitted, now I spit it, however do you want it?\
Now you get it!\
Writing rhymes, in the Range, with the frames lightly tinted\
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented (Lauryn Hill!)\
And if your lines sound like mine I'm taking a percentage (ka-ching!)\
Unprecedented, and still respected when it's vintage\
I'm serious, I'm takin' over areas in Aquarius\
Runnin' red lights with my ten thousand chariots\
Just as Christ was a Superstar, you stupid, star!\
They'll hail you then nail you, no matter who you are\
They'll make you now then take you down, and make you face it\
If you slit the bag open, put your pinky in it and taste it\

C'mon baby light my fire\

Preventing me from freedom, maintaining your pollution\
I won't support your lie no more\

If I have to die, oh Lord, that's how I choose to live\
I won't be compromised no more\
I can't be victimized no more\
I just don't sympathize no more, \'91cause now I understand\
You just wanna use me\
You say "love" then abuse me\
You never thought you'd lose me\
But how quickly we forget that nothin' is for certain\
You thought I'd stay here hurtin'\
Your guilt trip's just not workin', repressin' me to death\

Keeping me among the dead\
The only way to know\

But faith is not your speed\
Oh, you\'92d have everyone believe\
That you're the sole authority\
Just follow the majority\
Afraid to face reality\'97the system is a joke\
Oh, you'd be smart to save your soul\
Oh, and escape this mind control\
You spent your life in sacrifice to a system for the dead\
Oh, are you sure, where is the passion in this living?\
Are you sure it's God you serving?\
Obligated to a system\
Getting less then you're deserving\
Who made up these schools, I say\
Who made up these rules, I say\
Animal conditioning\
Oh, just to keep us as a slave\

Oh, just get out of this social purgatory\
Just get out, all these traditions are a lie\
Just get out, superstition killin' freedom\
Knowin' my condition is the reason I must die\

You ain't said nothin'\
Why you ain't say somethin' to me?\
(Boy 1)\
I feel like love right now is like confusion\
It's like people think they love somebody\
When they don't really love somebody\
Like I thought I was in love with this girl but I really wasn't\
It's like now, I don't feel about her\
(Laughter)\
[Teacher]\
Ok. Alright\
You think that TV and music have somethin' to do with\
Why people are always confused about love?\
(Girl 1)\
(Yes!)\
Why?\
(Cause today we listen to a lot of TV a lot of music\
And it sounds nice but it may not always be right for you)\

'The Sweetest Thing'\
\
\
Unexpected sound of the Refugee All-Stars\
\
[Verse 1]\
The sweetest thing I've ever known\
Was like the kiss on the collarbone\
The soft caress of happiness\
The way you walk, your style of dress\
I wish I didn't get so weak\
Ooh, baby, just to hear you speak\
Makes me argue just to see\
How much you're in love with me\
\
[Chorus]\
See like a queen, a queen upon her throne\
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known\
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known\
\
[Verse 2]\
I get mad when you walk away\
(Don't walk away from me, c\'92mon now)\
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay\
Warm as the sun dipped in black\
Fingertips on the small of my back\
More valuable than all I own\
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious, precious, baby, dark skin tone\

Speaking on my mother's phone\
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (You ain't grown)\
Sweet prince of the ghetto\
Your kisses taste like Amaretto\
Intoxicating (Intoxicating)\
Oh, so intoxicating (Intoxicating)\
How sad (So sad), how sad that all things come to an end\

'Every Ghetto, Every City'\

My mother always thought I'd be a star\
But way before the record deals\
Streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill\
Made sure that I'd never go too far\
\
[Chorus]\
Every ghetto, every city\
And suburban place I been\
Make me recall my days, in New Jerusalem\
\
[Verse 2]\
Story starts in Hootaville\
Grew up next to Ivy Hill\
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun\
"Kill the Guy" in Carter Park\
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark\
Watching kids show off the stolen ones\

Bag of Bontons, twenty cents and a nickel (well that's a quarter)\
Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles\
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu (wuh-TAH!)\
Main street roots tonic with the dreads\
A beef patty and some coco bread\
Move the patch from my Lee's to the tongue of my shoes\

Unaware of what we didn't have\
Writing my friends' names on my jeans with a marker\
July 4th races outside Parker\
Fireworks at Martin Stadium\
The Untouchable P.S.P\
Where all them crazy niggas be\
And car thieves got away through Irvington (skrrrt, lock it up, uh)\
Hillside brings beef with the cops\
Self Destruction record drops\
And everybody's name was Muslim (children playing, women producing)\
Sensations and eighty-eight\
Attracted kids from out of state\
And everybody used to do the wop (wop it out, wop it out, wop it out)\
Jack ya, jack ya, jack ya body\
Nah, the BizMark used to amp up the party\
I wish those days, they didn't stop\

'War in the Mind (Freedom Time)'\
\
\
Everybody knows that they guilty\
Resting on their conscience eating their inside\
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now\
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now\
Time to get free, or give yourselves up now\
It's freedom, said it's freedom time\
\
[Verse]\
Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory\
For the dominion\
Who will dominate the opinion\
Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion\
Conformin' our vision\
To the world church's decision\
Trapped in a section\
Submitted to committee election\
Moral infection\
Epidemic lies and deception\
Insurrection\
Of the highest possible order\
Destortin' our tape recorders\
From hearin' like under water\
Beyond the borders\
Find the sin in disorder\
Bound by the strategy\
A systematic depravity\
Heavy as gravity\
Head first in the cavity\
Without a bottom\
A fate, worse than Sodom\
What's got 'em, drunk off the spirits\
Truth comes, we can't hear it\
When you've been, programmed to fear it\
I had a vision I was fallin' in indescision\
Apallin', callin' religious\
Some program on television\
How can, dominant wisdom\
Be recognized in the system\
Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules\
Intelligent fools\
PhDs in illusion\
Masters of mass confusion\
Bachelors in past delusion\
Now who you choosin'?\
The head, or the tail\
The bloodshed of the male\
Or confidence in the tale\
Conferences is Yale\
Discussin' doctrines of Baal\
Causin' people to fail\
Keepin' the third in jail\
His word has nailed\
Everything to the tree\
Severing all of me\
From all that I used to be\
Formless and void\
Totally paranoid\
Enjoy darkness as Lord\
Keepin' me from the sword\
Block for mercy\
Bitter than cerasee\
Hungry and thirsty\
For good meat we would eat\
And still, dined at the table of deceit\
How incomplete\
From confrontation to retreat\
We belong, in true enemies defeat\
Destitute in a necessity\
Causin' desperation to get the best of me\
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me\
Realizin' the inescapable death of me\
No options in the valley of decision\
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision\
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart\
From words to fiery darts\
Thrown by the workers of the arts\
Iniquity, shapen in\
There's no escapin' when\
Your whole philosophy is paper thin\
In vanity\
The wide road is insanity\
Could it be all of humanity\
Picture that\
Scripture that\
The origin of a man's heart is black\
How can we show up for\
An invisible war\
Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore\
Achin' in sores\
Babylon, the great mystery\
Mother of human history\
System of social sorcery\
Our present condition\
Needs serious recognition\
Where there's no repentance there can be no admission\
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam\
The atom bomb and Saddam and Minister Farrakhan\
What's goin' on, what's a priority to you\
By what authority do to you\
The majority hasn't a clue\
We majored in curses\
Search the chapters, check the verses\
Recapture the land\
Remove the mark from off of our hands\
So we can stand\
In agreement with his command\
Everything else is damned\
Let them with ears understand\
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand\

'Motives and Thoughts'\
\
\
Human condition, morals corrupted\
Trapped in reaction, lawlessness, war\
Dissatisfaction from bowels to core\
Devil's technology, strategy for\
Human mythologies, urban folklore\
Sick of psychology, counterfeit cure\
Wicked theology, robbing the poor\
Scheme demonology mislead the pure\
Strictly strategically studying war\
Light shown in darkness, image exposed\
Few can see through the new emperor's clothes\
Lustful this hustle turn humans to hoes\
When the blind lead the blind, just more trouble and woes\
It's the mind that they chose\
Its designed to stay closed\
Standard of jokers, court jester logic\
Sick looking cosmics, from schoolyards to college\
Primitive man with civilized knowledge\
System collapse and he still won't acknowledge\
God is the saviour, studies behavior\
Trying to fix the mix mind that he gave ya\
Stiff-necked scholars on prescription meds\
Wishing their problems were all in their heads\
Moral dilemma, pride is the root\
Misguided from youth, heart divided from truth\
Egyptians and Grecians, spiritually dead\
Imperially led, by the gods in their heads\
Motives and thoughts\
Industrial wealth\
Global economy, in it for self\
Heart full of madness, covered with kind\
Pleasure designed to take over your mind\
Furnished in godliness, painted in good\
This tainted priesthood got real saints misunderstood\
While classes in government, set up the veil\
And cultivate minds for more mythical tales\
Typical Hollywood follies good girl\
While vice and corruption take over the world\
Motives and thoughts\
Check your motives and thoughts\
Blind with the wickedness, deep in your heart\
Modern day wickedness is all you've been taught\
Lied to your neighbors, so you get ahead\
Modern day trickery is all you've been fed\

See, the road to hell is paved with good intentions\
Can't you tell, the way they have to mention\
How they helped you out? You're such a hopeless victim\
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional\
\
[Verse 2]\
All their talk is seasoned to perfection\
The road they walk, commanding your affection\
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation\
An opportunity to further situation\
Why they're so important is without explanation\
Please don't patronize me, Mr. Intentional\
Oh, oh, oh\
\
[Verse 3]\
We give rise to ego by being insecure\
The advice that we go desperately searching for\
The subconscious effort to support our paramour\
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature\
Validating lies, Mr. Intentional\

And your expensive misinventions\
Disguising your intentions\
Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr. Intentional\
\
[Verse 5]\
See, I know you can't help me, Mr. Intentional\
The only help I need to live is unprofessional\
The only wealth I have to give is not material\
And if you need much more than that, I'm not available\
Please don't entertain me, Mr. Intentional\
Oh, I don't need your sympathy, Mr. Intentional\

'Adam Lives in Theory'\
\
\
Cut off from the sunshine, only smart in his own head\
Leaving his descendants to hope and doubt\
Left to his devices, those worthless sacrifices\
Praying to the altar of himself\
Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious\
Like he's got all the light, and no one else\
He takes the unsuspected\
'Cause he knows they're not connected\
And he shows them how to be just as he is\
Virtually real\
And commercially appealed\
To the lust of all the people where he lives\
Eve was so na\'efve, blinded by the pride and greed\
Wanting to be intellectual\
Drifting from the way, she got turned down one day\
And now she thinks that she's bisexual\
Caught up in emotion\
Burning up in her devotion\
To the king of exploitation in the field\
She handed him her virtue\
'Cause he told her, "I won't hurt you"\
So she lay with him to see how good it feels\

[Verse 2]\
Now after the sensation, and the empty fornication\
She brought affection home into her bed\
Quickly multiplying, now the 3 of them are dying\
By the poison she perceived to be good (head!)\
Now Eve and her husband are perverted in their judgment\
'Cause everything appears to be the same\
They entertain suggestion, next time just use protection\
Desiring to cover up their shame\
But much to their demise\
Poor decision closed their eyes\
To the very antidote to their dilemma\
Burning in their lust\
Both of them adulterous\
Destroying the original agenda\
Praying to the sky in order to maintain a lie\
They exhausted every possible conclusion\
They can't even entertain the solution in a brain\
Filled with vain information and pollution\
Hiding from the truth\
He provided an excuse\
To explain away his desperate situation\
When confronted, blamed his wife\
Giving birth to carnal life\
Refusing to acknowledge what he done\
Now if we can agree with who created us to be\
Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes\
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception\
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies\

Now can you tell me, what, what we gonna do now?\
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?\

[Verse 3]\
Stop walking in pride, let the thief be crucified\
Un-learn everything you know, and let Him teach you\
Line upon line, and precept upon precept, say goodbye\
To this decaying social system\
He wants to know how far we're willing to go\
If we love him like we say we do, He'll try us\
Just you don't regress or slip into hopelessness\
Once He's satisfied, His love, He won't deny us\
[Hook]\
And then He'll tell us, what, what we gonna do now?\
Where we gonna go now? What we gonna say now?\
And then He'll tell us, what, what we gonna do now?\

Is all the consequences\
You think our lives are cheap\
And easy to be wasted\
As history repeats\
So foul you can taste it\

[Verse 1]\
I'll never forget no way, how they crucified Jesus Christ\

But spiritual wickedness in high and low places\
And don't you fight me down\
I'll stand firm, and give Jah all the thanks and praises\
I don't expect to be justified, by these laws of men\
Though the wicked find me guilty, Jah will proove my innocency\

Moving down the streams of my lifetime\
Pulls the fascination in my sleeve\
Cooling off the fire of my longing\
Boiling off my cold within his heat\
Melting down the walls of inhibition\
Evaporating all of my fears\
Baptizing me into complete submission\
Dissolving my condition with his tears\
\
[Hook]\
He's just like the water\
I ain't felt this way in years\
He's just like the water\
I ain't felt this way in years\
\
[Verse 2]\
Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing\
Floating through the space of my design\
Drowning me to find my inside sailing\
Drinking in the mainstream of mind\
Filling up the cup of my emotions\
Spilling over into all I do\
If I only I could get lost in his ocean\
Surviving on the thought of loving you\

He causes my expression to remain\
Humbled on a mountain by his presence\
Washing my intentions with his name\
Sealing off the floodgates of his passions\
Saving all his liquid for his own\
Moisturizing me to satisfaction\
In my imagination? No no!\
He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours\
Drawing out my nature with his hands\
Yearning I'm so thirsty for his power\
Burning to be worthy of his land\

'Oh Jerusalem'\
\
\
Oh Jerusalem\
Oh Jerusalem\
\
[Verse 1]\
Realizing that there's no place else to go\
And there's nobody I know who can help me\
Textbook solutions are so improbable\
'Cause everybody else is just as empty\
\
Naked as the day that I was born, I tried to hide\
Behind education and philosophy\
Hopeless explanation to describe a situation\
I can't see because the world's on top of me\
\
[Verse 2]\
Oh, wretched man that I am, who will deliver me\
From the body of this death?\
Freeing me from dust and the superficial trust\
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath\
Failing to connect 'cause I'm morally defect\
By reason of the God inside my head\
Causing me to see only what pertains to me\
Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead\

Oh, wretched man that I am, who will deliver me\
From the body of this death?\
\
[Verse 4]\
Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor\
In this staged interpretation of this day\
Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light\
Too intelligent to see it's me in the way\
What a paradox, having God trapped in a box\
All this time professing to be spiritual\
Naturally pretending that I'm actually defending\
God through my facade, don't need material\
\
[Hook]\
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness\
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception\
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?\
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection\
[Verse 5]\
Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth\
So we could walk in the council of authority\
Forget the proof, our generation so aloof\
Only follow in the steps of the majority\
\
Trust in the Lord with all thy heart\
And lay not to thine, oh an understanding in all thy ways\
Acknowledge Him and He shall direct our paths\
Be not wise in thine own eyes and you can follow him\
\
We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them\
Who religion tells us that we should ignore\
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him\
Exposed by the very things that we adore\
\
[Verse 6]\
We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man\
Who has a different point of view then us\
Infuriated 'cause he doesn't understand\
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss\
\
Why still do evil? We don't know how to do good\
Walking on in darkness running from the light, hey\
Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods\
Telling us what's going on will be alright\
Oh, so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed\
When I played with my game of Monopoly\
Oh, to suggest that my life is still a mess\
Who reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me\
\

Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness\
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception\
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?\

Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear\
Fruit of itself except in the vine\
I am the vine, ye are the branches, he that live in me\
And I in him, the same bring forth much fruit\
For without me, you can do nothing\
Oh Jerusalem, you're traditions have deceived you\
I've chosen you, you haven't chosen me\
Do whatsoever, you asking my name he may give to you\
\
But in vain they call my name, teaching doctrines just the same\
Justified among themselves\
But God know with the heart, what man esteemed as smart\
Is an abomination to Emmanuel\
\
[Verse 8]\
Just repent, turn from selfish motivation\
So iniquity will not cause your demise\
Make you a new heart and a new spirit\
For why would he die? Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why\
\
I have no pleasure in the death of him to die\
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live\
It's not the talkers, but the walkers and His Word\
Are the only ones the Father will forgive\

'Selah'\

But that'll only work a little while\
Coping with despair, knowing you're not there\
Ashamed to just admit I've been a fool\
So I blame it on the sun, run away from everyone\
Hoping to escape this ridicule\
Trapped in misery, wrapped so miserably\
And this deception, I wear it like a skin\
Dying to maintain, oh I keep trying to explain\
A heart that never loved me to begin\
Oh I'm such a mess, I have no choice but to confess\
That I've been desperately trying to belong\
Lieing to myself and everybody else\
Refusing to admit my right was wrong\

Oh what's left of me, I beg you desperately\
Cause me to agree with what I know is best for me\
Please save me from myself, I need you, save me from myself\
Please save me from myself so I can heal\
The choices that I've made, oh have been nothing but mistakes\
What a wasted use of space, should I die before I wake\

But when the undercurrents come, and pull you out to sea\
I'm left with shells and slippery rocks where you used to be\
And when the sun comes beating down and burns my body dry\
It's hard to wait until the tide to quench my thirst, so I cry, I cry\
Cry, cry, and then at last, the sun goes down\
And leads into your sea\
And I can feel your desperate hands all over me, all over me\
I dream of you, when I know I shouldn't, shouldn't\
You are hurting me and you said that you wouldn't\
You promised me you wouldn't you wouldn't\
I said I'd be with you and I know I couldn't\

'Interlude 5'\
\
\
A yes is fine (laughing) okay?\
(voice from audience \'93I love that song\'94)\
Thank you. Praise God.\
\
I tell you, I know everybody\'92s in the same mess. I\'92m telling you.\
We all are.\
I, I, I know that, you know...\
and I\'92m just, you know, I\'92ll be the first to tell you, you know,\
I\'92m a mess and God is dealing with me everyday. And everyday I\'92m trying, you know, how I can be less of a mess. Cuz you know, he showed me, Look Lauryn, you know, You\'92re the problem, okay, I\'92m going to show you how you\'92re causing the problem, and now I want you to be the solution. And that\'92s what all of these songs are about, just, problem, cause and solution. Free your mind.\
\
It\'92s like, we all think that the gospel is join and church building, and that\'92s deception, you know.\
The real gospel is Repent, which means \'91let go of all that crap,\'92 that\'92s killin\'92 you.\
Life was supposed to be a pleasurable experience, not this torment, you know.\
And when I realized that I was tormenting myself, it was about my lust.\
It wasn\'92t about things that I needed it was just, you know, all these security blankets. I mean, the more I acquired I became more of a prisoner. I mean, you know, forty people on staff, and you can\'92t do nothing, and now creativity is impossible because all you can think about is all these folks that you know, you\'92re supporting and carryin\'92 and you know, it\'92s not good. You know, everybody\'85\
a friend of mine says that every tub has to stand on it\'92s own bottom, you know. And in that respect, we all get to do what our passion is.\
See , that\'92s what praisin God is all about, is doing your passion.\
\
You know, it\'92s not useless, worthless ritual, you know, monotonous ritual, where we just show up and can\'92t wait to see the game, you know. It\'92s doing your passion and fulfilling your passion. You know.\
That\'92s how we\'92re thankful. That\'92s how we say we appreciate the opportunity to be alive.\
\
And I\'92m just glad that I, you know, I don\'92t have to slave anymore. You know, cuz I, music was my love, and because of everything I thought had to accompany my music it became my burden. It just got stolen from me. I said, What is this? How did this thing that I love so much so easily and so quickly turn to something I loath and hate?\
And so now, you know, I understand that it was because I was measuring myself or trying to compare myself to a standard that wasn\'92t reality. It wasn\'92t the standard at all, you know. T\
here\'92s a scripture in the Bible that we, what does it say, it says \'91We compare ourselves amongst ourselves\'92 you know. That\'92s not the standard. You already are the standard. What are you trying to fit into a standard for? We were each created to be individual standards, you know. And we\'92re trying to fit into a standard? It doesn\'92t make any sense, you know.\
So now I\'92m just, you know, after all that, I\'92m just ready to be me. And it\'92s a lot to work through, you know, because all of us have hidden in these little boxes purposely, because of parts of ourselves that we were unhappy about. And it\'92s because we didn\'92t understand, you know, because there\'92s all this social doctrine that says, you know, that\
The infinite God, with all this expression,\
who created every single one of us,\
absolutely different,\
On purpose,\
wants everybody to fit into the same suit.\
But like, you know, that\'92s deception.\
That\'92s deception.\
\
(Talking to someone offstage) Okay, let me just, I think this is the wrong one (laughing) I don\'92t think this is the right one.\
\
We took\'85we were in, um, Florida this weekend and we took the kids to Disney world, and um, you know we were going, they gave us a tour. They escorted us through the back. And when they escorted us through the back, we got to see how, you know, there all these people workin all hard, and it was like, real dirty back there, and of course, in the front it was all immaculately clean.\
And I said, I said, you know, People need to see the reality, they need to see, you know, how these people slave to maintain this illusion.\
And it felt like my life. I said, If people only knew what it was.\
\
It\'92s like, you know, a bunch of musicians, listen, bustin\'92 their \'91mm\'92 workin all hard to make it look easy. What\'92s the point? You know, Oh, uh, I just threw this together, uh\'85(audience laughs).\
You know, it\'92s like, you know what I\'92m sayin?\
I mean, you know.\
Slaving.\
Slaving to act like, you know, I wake up like this. And none of us do, you know, none of us do.\
None of us do.\
And reality is good cuz that means everybody could just exhale, let your belly out, you know, and chill. You know. But people get mad at me when I say, Look, let\'92s stop frontin\'92. And I\'92m saying, you know, that\'92s the blessing.\
Now we can go around and look at each other and say, Oh, you got one too?!\
\
And be free.\
And we want to defend the curse. I\'92ll tell ya, that was not fun. Did it for a long time...\
\
Too long.\
(offstage) You didn\'92t find it? It\'92s another white one. But you see\'85in my purse. Or the, the other bag? Or the green one? Ghetto. You know, it\'92s reality, okay (laughing)?\
\
One time, it came to me, you know, I was just told very concretely.\
You know, it was like that voice, the right one, said to me,\
he said, Lauryn, You know the real you is more interesting than the fake somebody else.\
I just want you to know that.\
\
Because we always thought we could get, you know, we could get reality by just putting on the clothes and wearin\'92 the face and you know, lookin hard in the video. But, you know. Reality is..it\'92s like I\'92ve always told to my husband, it\'92s like, look, you know, we look at Bob Marley, you know, and we say Okay, let\'92s just grow locks and wear the clothes and have the band and we have no many idea how many years of struggle and pain and suffering that made that content. You see what I\'92m saying?\
\
You can\'92t get it from the outside in. Truth is from the inside out.\
\
You know, and the way we\'92ve been trying to heal and be healed is with these topical, surface, superficial, temporary solution. And I\'92m telling you, true healing is from the inside out. You know, we\'92ve been told to protect our outer man while our inner man is dying. (offstage) Oh, this is the one.\
\
Boy I\'92ll tell ya, God made him for me. I\'92m something to put up with. And to endure that is amazing. I\'92ll be the first to tell you, trust me. Y\'92all could clap cuz that\'92s some real work (more clapping). I was in there in the room, you know, before we came out here, and he said to me, I said, Ro should I change? And he said, Yeah. So I looked at him, I said, Why did you tell me to change I was comfortable, man. But I asked him the question. So I went in the room and I tried on all these clothes and I was like, I feel like an idiot. So I pulled out all these clothes and I\'92m sayin, ok Ro, you know, Pack the bag neatly, you know, Could you put the clothes back in? And he\'92s like, Alright. So he\'92s trying to do this but then I\'92m like, No! Now take this out! Now put that back and take that out! Put that back, hold that, take, that, put, The orange shoe! The orange shoe! So I\'92m like. And then after awhile I just said, Ro baby, could you leave? Please get out the room. And I just put back on the clothes I came in. Okay, I was like\'85I\'92m just not there anymore. Nah, I\'92m telling you. It\'92s like, uh (laughing). Hey you know he\'92s learned. Because before we used to just beef and now he\'92s like, Okay\'85I\'92m out. It\'92s real. God gave us a brand new relationship, man, I mean, one in truth, you know.\
\
It\'92s like, we date people, like let\'92s say, you know, we\'92re interested in somebody and we put on the perfume and dress up and then we do things that we will never ever ever do again! You understand what I\'92m sayin? It\'92s like\'85And that\'92s why so many marriages end up in divorce. It\'92s because people wake up next to a stranger.\
They say, Who the hell are you? What are you doing in this bed?\
Where\'92s that man that used to do \'91du, dua, and du.\'92\
And I\'92m sayin let\'92s give them reality from the door because: you\'92re going to attract love,\
and the one that really loves you. And then you don\'92t have to pretend and falsify, and you know, keep that posture.\
\
You know, you know, I can\'92t, I\'92m just like...I\'92ll never forget when I first met him I said to him, it was like, he saw me eating in front of him, and he told me, he was like, You eat like a man, you must not like me. You know, because, women, usually they keep that posture. And I said, Nah. I said it\'92s not even that, you know. It\'92s but, this is reality. This is, you know, and that\'92s it, man, I mean, I\'92m just telling you, it\'92s so wonderful to finally find\'85\
And trust me, it\'92s a work in progress, it\'92s not something that happens overnight.\
We all have to be introduced to each other.\
\
I\'92m telling you, I know that I\'92m up here and you see, Lauryn Hill, you came to see Lauryn Hill.\
But this is the first time y\'92all meet me. You see what I\'92m saying? Don\'92t think you met me before, okay. And as I grow, you\'92re going to meet me a little bit more. You\'92re gonna be exposed to the real me a little bit more. I can tell you I had to reintroduce myself to everybody I know. My mother my father. Listen, y\'92all never knew me. I want to introduce you to me. I\'92m just getting to know me. And you know what, anything that\'92s not growin' is dead, so we better be changing.\
\
You know, people would say to me, they would hold me hostage. And they, seriously, emotionally hostage, and they\'92d say, Uh, she\'92s changing. The money\'92s changing her. And I\'92d say Listen, the money\'92s not changing me, God\'92s changing me. I\'92m changing, because that\'92s a natural part of life. We\'92re all supposed to change. Who wakes up and is the same way tomorrow and the day after that? Nobody is. Let the experience teach you and be real, man.\
\
And, um..there\'92s gonna be warfare involved. Because there\'92s some people who prefer deceptions, see. They say, uh, I don\'92t like this new expression, and I say, what, you want two-thirds of me to stay outside? I\'92m a whole person. You can\'92t say, you know, two-thirds of Lauryn, come in here. Only two-thirds is acceptable. I\'92m a whole person. You know. And that\'92s everybody.\
\
You always talk about spiritual warfare and we didn\'92t realize that it was in relationships. It\'92s emotional warfare. Being able to tell the people we love the most the truth about ourselves. And when they say, Hey that doesn\'92t fit into our box for you, we say, well, I ain\'92t in no box. Don\'92t try to put me in one.\

'Just Like Water'\
\
\
Cooling off the fire of my longing\
Warming up my cold within his heat\
Bouncing down the walls of inhibition\
Evaporating all of my fears\
Baptizing me to complete submission\
Dissolving my condition with his tears\
\
[Chorus]\
It's just like the water\
I ain't felt this way in years\
It's just like the water, the water\
I ain't felt this way in years\
\
[Verse 2]\
Coursing through my senses, he's prevailing\
Floating through the space of my design\
Drowning me, I find my insides sailing\
Drinking in the mainstream of his mind\
Filling up the cup of my emotions\
Spilling over into all I do\
If only I could get lost in his ocean\
Surviving on the thought of loving you\

Bathing in the fountain of his essence\
He causes my expression to remain\
Humbled on the mountain by his presence\
Washing my intentions with his name\
Sealing all the floodgates of his passion\
Saving all his liquid for his own\
Moisturizing me to satisfaction\
In my imagination, oh no\
He's pouring out his soul to me for hours and hours\
Drawing out my nature with his hands\
Yearning, I'm so thirsty for his power\
Burning to be worthy of his land\

It's been three weeks since you were looking for your friend\
The one you let hit it and never called you again\
'Member when he told you he was 'bout the Benjamins?\
You act like you and him then give him a little trim\
\
To begin, how you think you really goin' to pretend\
Like you wasn't down when you called him again?\
Plus when you give it up so easy you ain't even foolin' him\
If you did it then, then you'd probably ... again\
\
Talking out your neck, saying you're a Christian\
A Muslim sleeping with the Jinn\
Now that was the sin that did Jezebel in\

When when come again (yeah yeah)\

The second verse is dedicated to the men\
More concerned with his rims and his Tims than his women\
Him and his men, come in the club like hooligans\
Don't care who they offend, popping yin (Like you got Yen)\
Let's stop pretend, the ones that pack pistols by the waist men\
Cristal by the case men, still living in his mother's basement\
The pretty face men claiming that they be the big men\
Need to take care of their three and four kids\
\
But they face a court case when the child support's late\
Money taking and heart breaking, now you wonder why women hate men\
The sneaky silent men, the punk domestic violence men\
Quick to shoot the semen, stop acting like boys and be men\

Do you think you too young to really love somebody\
No, no, no, no, no\
I say it for me and I am adult and I say wait you too young to be in love\
This is silly, you infatuated with them\
You got nice jeans\
You wear fancy Adidas\
I mean it might be something I don't know\
It is a difference from loving somebody and being in love with somebody\
Well you tell me, what's the difference\
What's the difference?\
You can love anybody but when you in love with somebody\
You looking at it like this\
You taking that person for what he or she is\
Not matter what he or she look like\
And no matter what he or she do\
If you can fall in love you can fall out of love\
You might stop being in love with that person, but you can't stop loving that person\
Sometimes they never been loved before, they never been in love before\
They don't know the feeling to be loved\

'Intro (MTV Unplugged No. 2.0)'\
\
\
Ok so, these are brand new songs that very few people have heard, very much about, you know, what I've been going trough and what I've been learning -- a lot of wonderful life lessons, you know, that aren't easy to come by but you're very blessed after you realize why you had to go trough what you had to go trough\
It's just very important that you really listen to the words, you know, and if you have a hard time to hear what I'm saying please just raise your hand, you know, or something, object! You guys ready in there? (All set) Ok\
And you know, it's real interesting because I used to be a performer, and I really don't consider myself a performer so much anymore. I'm really just... I'm sharing, you know, more or less the music that I've been given. But if I stop, if I start, if I... you know... feel like saying, "Baby, baby, baby" for eighteen bars -- whatever, you know? I just... I do that\
So You guys are cool? [Yeah!] Ok I'm talking to people in my head too. It's alright though. Let's just warm up a little bit. I'm just gonna finish sucking on my lozenger\

'I Remember'\
\
\
You saw right through me\
And I could not hide\
I was exposed\
Just like a child\
All of my heart\
You hold it in your hands\
I'm yours to command\
I'm yours to demand\
I, I feel so humble\
With you in my life\
With you in my life\
\
[Verse 2]\
I remember\
When I looked into your eyes\
I saw a reflection of myself\
And I could not lie\
Out of control\
Too weak to deny\
All of myself\
Is naked before you\
But what can I do\
There is nothing I can do\
I feel so beautiful\
With you in my life\
With you in my life\

'Interlude 3'\
\
\
\
This is a strange song because this song -- when this song was written, this is when everything sort of stopped. It was written a long time ago, but it was right before God just snatched me out of everything. And because I didn't understand... Initially it was written -- I'd written it about the whole Amadou Diallo situation, when it first happened. And I went to the studio, and I laid it down. And it was like, strong, for the first day. And then it just regressed everyday after that. And I said, "What's going on? What's happening?"\
\
And at the end of it there was a word that i used, "rebel." And I guess was afraid. It was such a hot time in the city at that point, I was afraid that if I\
Put the record out, people would misunderstand what I meant by "rebel" and they'd just take it to the streets. So I was very intimidated and afraid. And before I knew it a whole host of things happened. Everything stopped after that. And the creativity stopped. Everything stopped. That's when I realized I had to understand what I was talking about before I could tell somebody else what I was talking about. And I had to be, you know, a living example\
\
It's real crazy because I don't know what the press is saying because I don't listen to the press too much. But I know the view is that I'm emotionally unstable, which is reality. Like you aren't?\
\
I'm laughing because what I've realized I've become is one of those mad scientists who does the tests on themselves first, you see, to make sure that they work. And that's when you know, OK look, I got something that works. You know what I'm saying? I'm not gonna give you something that I haven't tested for myself. And you go through, and you're learning by way of experience, and you're making mistakes, and you're getting up\
\
A friend of mine once said to me, he said, Look, if we weren't supposed to turn around, why does a car have a steering wheel? Are we just supposed to crash into the wall? No, we're supposed to say, Listen, I was going the wrong way... Reverse!\

'Social Drugs'\
\
\
Afraid to address the reality before me\
To proud to confess that I'm addicted to a lie\
So I seek temporary feeling\
To replace reality\
Though the truth is telling me I have died\
\
But I've been taught to numb it\
Sedated, don't confront it\
I hate it when I find out\
That I can't get what I wanted\
This emotional tantrum\
Has become sort of an anthem playing every time I need to take a little trip\
\
To hide this condemnation\
I'll find a combination\
Of man-made stimulation\
To deny my situation\
Now this unreality\
Is distorting what I see\
Reporting back to me\
A sense of false security\
\
So in my imagination\
I must find a recreation\
Desperately in search of ways\
To alter my sensation\
There's no equilibrium\
Inebriated till I'm numb\
Intoxicated until I'm dumb\
To avoid confrontation\

Now this chemical analogy\
Is our emotional reality\
These political, traditional\
And ethnical stimulants\
And social etiquette\
Won't let us be too upset\
With the way things really are\
You're told to camouflage regret\
In a religious structure\
Tells us God wants us to suffer\
To support a situation we all know is obligation\
\
And if you shun the complication\
They'll just gun your reputation\
Like mob intimidation\
To enforce participation\
\
See they need to keep us fiends\
To their lies and broken schemes\
And if you find another means\
You're told you're being too extreme\
And if you wanted to get clean\
They'll just pull those social strings\
Holding up their social nose\
Defying noble things\
Now we're all stuck in tradition\
Unable to state opposition\
Too afraid to contradict\
The expectations of the system\
Oh and the harsh reality\
Is they made grace for you and me\
Instead of saving you and me\
They're just enslaving you and me\

There's a war in the mind\
For the territory over dominion\
Who will dominate opinions\
Schizims and isms\
Keeping us in forms of religion\
Conforming our vision\
To the world church's decision\
Trapped in a section\
Submitted to committee elections\
Moral infection\
Epidemic Lies and deception\
Insurrection\
Of the higest possible order\
Distorting our tape recorders\
From hearing like under water\
Beyond the borders\
Finding sin in disorder\
Bound by the strategy\
And systemic depravity\
Heavy as gravity\
Head first in the cavity\
Without a bottom\
A fate worse than Sodom\
What's got 'em drunk off the spirit?\
Truth comes and we can't hear it\
And you've been programmed to fear it\
I had a vision\
I was falling in indecision\
Appalling\
Calling religion some program on television\
How can dominant wisdom\
Be recognized in a system\
Of anti-christs and majority rules\
Intelligent Fools\
PhDs of ilusions\
Masters of mass confusion\
Bachelors of Past illusions\
Now, who you choosing?\
The head or the tail?\
The Bloodshed or the Male?\
Or confidence in the veil?\
Conferences at Yale\
Discussing Doctrines at Baal (pronounced Bale)\
Causing People to Fail\
Keeping A third in jail\
His word is nailed, everything to the tree\
Severing all the me\
From all I used to be\
Formless and void\
Totally paranoid\
Enjoyed darkness as lord\
Keeping me from the sword\
Blocked from mercy\
Bitter than Ceres\
Hungry and thirsty\
For good meat, we would eat\
And still dine at the table of deceit\
How incomplete\
From confrontation to retreat\
We belong to true enemy's defeat\
Destitute a necessity\
Causing desperation to get the best of me\
Punishment 'till there was nothing left of me\
Realizing the inescapable death of me\
No options in the valley of decision\
The only option supernatural circumcision\
Inwardly\
Only water can purge the hearts from words\
The firey darts\
Thrown by the workers of the arts\
Iniquity\
Shaping in\
There's no escaping when\
Your whole philosiphy is paper thin\
In vanity\
The wide road is insanity\
Can it be all of humanity\
Picture that\
Scripture that\
The origin of man's heart is black\
How can we show up for\
An invisible war\
Preoccupied with a shadow\
Making love with a whore\
Aching in sores\
Babylon the great mystery\
Mother of human history\
System of social socercery\
Our present condition needs serious recongnition\
Where's there's no repentance there can be no remission\
And that sentence more serious than Vietnam\

'Interlude 1'\
\
\
\
And at that point I had to do some dying and really accept the fact that, look, "this is who I am, and I have to be who I am, and all of us have a right to be who we are, and whenever we submit our will, because our will is a gift, it is given to us, so whenever we submit our will to someone else's opinion, you know, I mean, a part of us dies."\
\
You know, and so it's been, um... it's been... it actually hasn't been a long time. It feels like a long time, but it hasn't been a long time. Some miraculous things have happened in a short amount of time, and uh, I'm just very blessed to be able to be here today and get to share with you some of the things I've learned.\
\
I know some of it sounds almost cryptic and I been really just, just really... waiting for the patience and really just articulate where I'm coming from as simply as possible, so I'm working on that.\
\
But um... you know, I know, that you know that there's, uh... you know that I know that God doesn't lie and I know that he knows how to talk to the hearts of people better than anybody else, so I don't worry about that, cause whatever he relates to whomever is listening, that's what supposed to be understood at that time, so it's all good.\

'Lose Myself'\
\
\
And all I ever wanted was love\
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me\
Tried to make me feel like I was unworthy\
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty\
Truth was they never did deserve me\
No!\
\
Chorus:\
I had to lose myself so I could love you better\
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could\
Love you better\
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself\
So I could love you better\
Had to lose myself in love\
And that's just the way it is\'85\
\
Couldn't tell me I was loved when I needed it\
When, all I ever wanted was love\
Shoulda told me just because\
I'm worth receiving it\
But all I ever wanted was love\
There's something awesome about the selflessness it\
Takes to\
Give love and the good that it makes you\
True love can never really forsake you\
But it took a little while just for me to see\

And so it goes that I never meant to hurt you\
Couldn't stay but I never meant to desert you\
Whole lot a things I just had to work through\
Time to heal and restore my self-worth too\
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety\
Cried a whole lot years, I suffered quietly\
And though it may have taken years I can finally\
Tell you that you were always on my mind\

'Open Tumblr Letter on Racism'\
\
\
\
Ironically, these oppressors would try to discard this same God, who supposedly justified this brutality, in the name of Darwin, whose famous line \'91survival of the fittest\'92 was used to justify criminal behavior once the Bible could no longer be used as a hiding place for economic domination and evil intention.\
Spirituality and morality were replaced by capitalism, and with it a conscious shift of focus toward the exploitation of the vulnerable.\
\
In order to justify reverse racism one would have to first create an even playing field, undo the generations of torture, terror, and brutality, and then judge whether or not a non-white person is in fact a racist. This approach would require people to examine the need/addiction to feel superior to someone else for no justifiable reason, and the myriad policies: Spiritual, political and social, that it bore. True dominion is self evident and not the result of sabotaging another in order to achieve it. That would be an illegitimate as well as a fleeting position. The Universe, will eventually seek to right/balance itself.\
Of course there are white people who live transcendent lives, not exploiting ill-gotten privilege or perpetuating the sins of their ancestors who used violence and deceit as a means to gain advantage over others. Humanity in proper order is obligated to acknowledge the Truth, whoever it comes from, be they Black, White or other. Righteous indignation is simply a response to long-standing evil.\
\
Much of the world is still reeling from the abuses of Imperialist selfishness, misunderstanding, ignorance and greed. Black people remain in many ways a shattered community, disenfranchised, forcefully removed from context and still caged in, denied from making truly independent choices and experiencing existential freedom. Their natural homes, just like their natural selves, raped and pillaged of the resources and gifts God has given to them. Interpreted through someone else\'92s slanted lens and filter, they remain in many ways, misrepresented. Taxation without proper representation, might I remind you, was the very platform of protest that began the Revolutionary War, which gained this country its independence from England. Anger is not only the natural response to the abuse of power, but is also appropriate when there is no real acknowledgment of these abuses, or deep, meaningful and profound change.\
\
If we took all of what we deem horrible regarding the criminal abuses that black people have committed over this country\'92s history, and add it all up, it still does not compare to the hundreds of years of terrorism, violent domination, theft, rape, abuse, captivity, and beyond that black people have suffered under the ideologies and systems of white supremacy, racism, and slave based paradigms. I say this only to say that abuse unresolved begets or creates abuse. How then does the chief offender become the judge? Might does not necessarily mean right. Right is right. People forcibly reduced to sub-human existences, so that they behave in sub-human ways, helps a system to justify itself or feel less guilty about its blood saturated foundation and gross crimes against humanity. People, like plants, grow where the light is. When you enclose a plant and limit its light source, it will bend itself toward the light, for the light is necessary for its survival. This same thing happens to people locked in communities where little light and little opportunity is allowed them, survival then forces them to twist and/or bend toward the only way of escape.\
\
There is good. And I both acknowledge and encourage the good. Instead of throwing out the Baby with the bath water, we do well to expose the intentionally poisoned water the Baby has been forced to soak in since its origin in these lands. America\'92s particular brand of hypocrisy is gross (double entendre).\
\
I shuddered during sentencing when I kept hearing the term \'91make the IRS whole\'92\'85 make the IRS whole, knowing that I got into these very circumstances having to deal with the very energies of inequity and resistance that created and perpetuated these savage inequalities. The entire time, I thought, who has made black people whole?! Who has made recompense for stealing, imposing, lying, murdering, criminalizing the traumatized, taking them against their wills, destroying their homes, dividing their communities, \'91trying\'92 to steal their destinies, their time, stagnating their development, I could go on and on. Has America, or any of the nations of the world guilty of these atrocities, ever made black people or Africa whole or do they continue to sit on them, control them, manipulate them, cage them, rob them, brutalize them, subject them to rules that don\'92t apply to all? Use language, veiled coercion, and psychological torment like invisible fences to keep them locked into a pattern of limitation and therefore control by others. You have to remain focused to cease from rage.\
\
The prosecutor, who was a woman, made a statement during sentencing about me not doing any charity work for a number of years during my \'91exile.\'92 A) Charity work is not a requirement, but something done because someone wants to. I was clearly doing charitable works way before other people were even thinking about it. And B) Even the judge had to comment that she, meaning I, was both having and raising children during this period. As if that was not challenging enough to do. She sounded like the echo of the grotesque slave master, who expected women to give birth while in the field, scoop the Baby up, and then continue to work. Disgusting.\
\
When you are beaten and penalized for being independent, or truly self reliant, then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with self-reliance, and a fear of true independence. When you are beaten or threatened with death for trying to read a book, then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with education. When families are broken up by force and threat of violence, then the family structure becomes dysfunctional. When men who would naturally defend their women and families are threatened with castration and death, then this natural response also becomes dysfunctional. When looking at the oppressor is punishable by violence, then examination of him and his system becomes a difficult and taboo thing to do, despite every bone in your body demanding it. When questioning or opposing oppression is punishable by death, imprisonment, or economic assassination, then opposing systemic wrong in any or all of its meta manifestations is a terrifying concept. Anyone forced to live so incredibly diametrically opposed to that which is natural to themselves, will end up in crisis if they don\'92t successfully find a way to improve or transcend these circumstances! All of which require healing. It is only by the Grace of God and the resilience of the people that things haven\'92t been worse.\
\
Much of my music, if not all of it, is about Love, a therapeutic resolve created in response to the lack of messages encouraging people like me toward free moral agency. Helping to ameliorate this condition has never been addressed through the political arena alone. It is a sacrificial work that doesn\'92t simply happen between the hours of 9 to 5 or Monday through Friday, but when inspiration leads us to avail ourselves for the Truth that needs to be said. Unlike the system too often contrarily demonstrates, we believe that people can be and should be helped, and that trauma should not be criminalized but acknowledged, healed and dealt with. This takes awareness, sensitivity and a level of freedom in my opinion the system lacks. And if we don\'92t know or understand how to do it, then we humbly refer to a higher authority.\
We have no desire to create humanoids, turn people into machines, or dumb them down so that they remain dependent longer than necessary to an antiquated system in denial of its many inadequacies and need to evolve. Instead we seek to educate and shed light on the snares, traps, and enticements that people set up in the name of business that are intended only to catch the sleeping and/or uninformed.\

'Zion'\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
Unsure of what the balance held\
I touched my belly overwhelmed\
By what I had been chosen to perform\
But then an angel came one day\
Told me to kneel down and pray\
For unto me a man child would be born\
\
Woe this crazy circumstance\
I knew his life deserved a chance\
But everybody told me to be smart\
Look at your career they said\
"Lauryn baby, use your head"\
But instead I chose to use my heart\
\
[Chorus]\
Now the joy of my world is in Zion\
Now the joy of my world is in Zion\
\
[Verse 2]\
How beautiful if nothing more\
Than to wait at Zion's door\
I've never been in love like this before\
Now let me pray to keep you from\
The perils that will surely come\
See, life for you my prince has just begun\
You might also likeAnd I thank you for choosing me\
To come through unto life to be\
A beautiful reflection of his grace\
See, I know that a gift so great\
Is only one God could create\
And I'm reminded every time I see your face\
\
[Chorus]\
That the joy of my world is in Zion\
Now the joy of my world is in Zion\
Now the joy of my world is in Zion\
Now the joy of my world is in Zion\

'Ex-Factor (A Simple Mix)'\

Loving you is like a battle we both end up scarred\
Tell me who I have to be to get some reciprocity\
No one loves you more than me and no one ever will\
Is this just a silly game that forces you to act this way\
Forces you to scream my name, then pretend, that you can't stay\
Tell me who I have to be to get some reciprocity\
No one loves you more than me and no one ever will\

No matter how I think we grow\
You always seem to let me know\
It ain't workin, it ain't workin, uhh\
And when I try to walk away\
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay\
This is crazy, this is crazy..\
\
I keep letting you back in, how can I explain myself?\
As crazy as this thing has been, I just can't be with no one else\
I know what we've got to do, you let go I'll let go too\
No one's hurt me more than you and no one ever will\
\
Yo, y-yo, yo yo- I'm here now, not just because it's my year now\
I'm clear now, only feelin cats that's sincere now\
Heart of lioness, scientist, street Zionist\
Don't twist it, it's consistantly consistent\
If you missed it, this train is bound for glory\
End of story, my whole repoitory is Psalm 40\
They bomb for me\
Thinkin they can mess with your plan, but I'mma play lamb\
Knowin that the Kingdom's at hand, and showin those who want it\
You gon' bring em the land, descendants of Ham\
Not concerned with the platinum status\
Cause every joint I threw, I would do for gratis\
I'm on the train with my Pips like I'm lil Gladys\
Or in the Range throwin chips to the kids in Addis (Ethiopia)\

Hot to lava, we Don Dadda, Don Dadda\

'Break My Heart'\
\
\
Had to\uc0\u8197 get it wrong to know just\u8197 what I like\
Now I'm falling\
You say my name like I have never heard before\
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure\
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all\
Are you falling?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Centre of attention\
You know you can get whatever you want from me\
Whenever you want it, baby\
It's you in my reflection\
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me\
If I would've known it, baby\
\
[Chorus]\
I would've stayed at home\
'Cause I was doing better alone\
But when you said, "Hello"\
I knew that was the end of it all\
I should've stayed at home\
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go\
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\
Oh no, I was doing better alone\
But when you said, "Hello"\
I knew that was the end of it all\
I should've stayed at home\
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go\
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\
[Verse 2]\
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind\
Two can play that game, but you win me every time\
Everyone before you was a waste of time\
Yeah, you got me\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Centre of attention\
You know you can get whatever you want from me\
Whenever you want it, baby\
It's you in my reflection\

If I would've known it, baby\
\
[Chorus]\
I would've stayed at home\
'Cause I was doing better alone\
But when you said, "Hello"\
I knew that was the end of it all\
I should've stayed at home (I would've stayed at home 'cause I\'96)\
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go\
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\
Oh no, I was doing better alone\
But when you said, "Hello"\
I knew that was the end of it all\
I should've stayed at home\
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go\
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?\

'We\'92re Good'\

[Pre-Chorus]\
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could\
It's time I wave goodbye from the window\
Let's end this like we should and say we're good\
\
[Chorus]\
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine\
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways\
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else\
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself\
Let's end it like we should and say we're good\
\
[Verse 2]\
No need to hide it, go get what you want\
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge\

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could\
It's time I wave goodbye from the window\
Let's end this like we should and say we're good\

Let's end it like we should and say we're good\

Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would\
I'm trying my best to make this easy\
So don't give me that look, just say we're good\
\
[Chorus]\
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine\
(Like sleeping and cocaine)\
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways\

\
I'm running and I'm crawling\
Fighting for you\
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?\
And I know I go all in, but why do I?\
\
[Chorus: Dua Lipa]\
You give me a reason, something to believe in\
I know, I know, I know\
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in\
I know, I know, I know\
It's a bittersweet feeling\
Longing, and I'm leaving\
I go, I go, I go\
But I wish I was there with you\
Oh, I wish I was there with you\
\
[Verse 2: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]\
There's a crack in my window\
A bird in my room\
Angels all over that watch over you\
When I'm walking on water\
All my dreams have come true\
Still, nothing means nothing\
Without you, you\
[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]\
You give me a reason, something to believe in\
I know, I know, I know\
You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in\
I know, I know, I know\
It's a bittersweet feeling\
Longing, and I'm leaving\
I go, I go, I go\
Tell my heart to lie, but I know deep inside it's true\
That I wish I was there with you\
That I wish I was there with you\
Oh, I wish I was there with you\
\

[Chorus: Dua Lipa & Chris Martin]\
You give me a reason, something to believe in\

I\uc0\u8197 can't believe there's something left in\u8197 my chest anymore\

He calls me the devil\
I make him wanna sin\
Every time I knock\
He can't help but let me in\
Must be homesick for the real\
I'm the realest it gets\
You'd probably still adore me\
With my hands around your neck\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah\
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol\
Where I'm coming from, yeah\
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb\

You ain't gonna walk free, boy\
Not finished with you yet, no\

Baby, you should touch me right there\
If you take me right there\
We could make it\

'Boys Will Be Boys'\
\
\
Isn't it funny how we\uc0\u8197 laugh it off to hide our fear\
When there's nothing funny here? (Ah)\
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out\
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths\
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south\
But there's nothing funny now (Ah)\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
When will we stop saying things\
'Cause they're all listening?\
No, the kids ain't alright\

Boys will be, boys will be\
Boys will be, boys will be boys\
But girls will be women\
Boys will be, boys will be\
Boys will be, boys will be boys\
[Verse 2]\
I'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to say\
I know that there will be a man around to save the day\
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained\
I should've stuck to ballet (Ah)\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
When will we stop saying things\
'Cause they're all listening?\
No, the kids ain't alright\

If you're offended by this song\
You're clearly doing something wrong\
If you're offended by this song\
Then you're probably saying\
Boys will be, boys will be\
Boys will be, boys will be boys\
But girls will be women\
[Pre-Chorus]\
When will we stop saying things\

No, the kids ain't alright\

I can't stop thinking 'bout you\
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through\

Everything you say is soundin' so sweet (Ah-ah)\
But do you practise everythin' that you preach? (Ah-ah)\

Yeah, you guessed it, the kind that's fun\
Hate it when you leave me unattended\
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love\
When my mind is runnin' wild\
Could you help me slow it down?\

Put my mind at ease\
Pretty please\
I need your hands on me\
Sweet relief\
Pretty\
Put my mind at ease\
Trickle down my spine\
Oh, you look so pretty, please\
Every single night, I need your hands on me\
When your kisses climb\
Oh, you give me sweet relief\
Made me feel so pretty\
Would you help me out, please?\

You love to disappoint me, don't ya?\
You tell me\uc0\u8197 what\u8197 I want, but\u8197 ain't no follow through\
You don't follow\uc0\u8197 through, no\

Then I think maybe we could probably see this through\
We could make it through, but\

I've been thinking it'd be better\
If we didn't know each other\
Then you go and make me feel okay\

Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to\
Every day and every night\

How can we go back to the beginning?\
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in\
How can we go back to the beginning?\
[Verse 2]\
Don't matter what's written\
We can start all over again, all over again\

My deep intuition\
Tells me that I'm doing you wrong, if I don't come home\
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go\

Chasing all of the flashing lights\

'Training Season'\

But if you really wanna go there\
You should know I\

My heart wide open\
Fallin' in and out of focus\
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head\
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city\
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette\

To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad\

'No Goodbyes'\
\
\
Maybe one day, it'll be cool\
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings\
When we start saying things\
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me\
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back\
And we tried hard just to fix it\
But we broke it more\
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last\
Is it too much to ask?\
\
[Chorus]\
For tonight\
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)\
Just for tonight\
Pretend that it's all alright (All alright)\
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?\
Just for tonight\
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)\
\
[Post-Chorus]\
No goodbyes\
No goodbyes\
No goodbyes, eh\
[Verse 2]\
In a dark room\
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you\
We can stay blind in the meantime\
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate\
Even though it's too late\

For tonight\
Let's love like there's no goodbyes (No goodbyes)\

I just want a touch, I ain't here for love no more\
Okay, yeah\

[Chorus]\
I won't stop, nah, no\

'Garden'\
\
\
Remember when we ran in the open?\
Now we know what's in the wild\
Used to think that this love was Heaven sent\
How did we get lost? Can't get back again\
Tell me, is there light on the outside?\
\
[Chorus 1]\
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?\
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?\
\
[Verse 2]\
Used to walk around your apartment\
Nothing but a smile on me\
But tonight I'm so self conscious\
Isn't it so clear to see?\
Nothing's ever perfect in Paradise\
Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price\
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?\
\
[Chorus 2]\
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?\
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?\
Now I know what I know\
But it\'92s hard to find the meaning\
Where do we go?\
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden\
(Eden, Eden, Eden)\
This Garden of Eden?\
(Eden, Eden, Eden)\
[Verse 3]\
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you\
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?\
Tell the truth, what you wanna do\
Is it me and you?\
Are you with me, honey?\
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you\
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?\
Tell the truth, what you wanna do\
Is it me and you?\
Are you with me?\
\
[Chorus 2]\
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?\
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?\
Now I know what I know\
But it's hard to find the meaning\
Where do we go?\
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden\
(Eden, Eden, Eden)\
This garden of Eden\
(Eden, Eden, Eden)\
\
[Bridge]\
Remember when we swam in the ocean?\
Now we know what's deep inside\
Remember when we ran in the open?\
[Chorus 3]\
So are we leaving?\
(Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?)\
Are we leaving?\
(Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?)\
Now I know what I know\
But it's hard to find the meaning\
Where do we go?\

[Chorus 1]\
Bang bang\
He shot me down\
Bang bang\
I hit the ground\
Bang bang\
That awful sound\

'Bad Together'\

I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse\
Baby, you're okay\
Baby, you're okay\
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart\
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar\
Felt that when we got closer in the dark\
Baby, I'm okay\

[Pre-Chorus]\
Baby, when\
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good\

Let's be bad together, make the devil smile\
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah\
[Verse 2]\
Nothing could stop us, we got it all\
The love, the passion, but most of all\
We mess up, but run from the scene\
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean\
Ah, 'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong\
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone\
We make a great team\
With you, I'm badder than I've ever been\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\

'Training Season (Extended)'\
\
\
Or just the poison that I'm drawn to?\
It can be hard to tell the difference late at night\
Play fair\
Is that a compass in your nature?\
Or are you tricky 'cause I've been there?\
And, baby, I don't need to learn my lesson twice\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
But if you really wanna go there\
But if you really wanna go there\
But if you really wanna go there\
You should know I\

Need someone to hold me close\
Deeper than I've ever known\
Whose love feels like a rodeo\
Knows just how to take control\
When I'm vulnerable\
He's straight talking to my soul\
Conversation overload\
Got me feeling vertigo\
[Post-Chorus]\
Are you somebody who can go there?\
'Cause I don't wanna have to show ya\
If that ain't you, then let me know, yeah\
'Cause training season's over\

I tried\
To see my lovers in a good light\
Don't wanna do it just to be nice\
Don't wanna have to teach you how to love me right\
I hope\
It hits me like an arrow\
Someone with some potential\
Is it too much to ask for?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Who understands I\

Run when you hear that whistle blow\
Are you on my team or stuck on the sidelines\
Waiting for someone to tell you to go?\
For someone to tell you to go\

[Pre-Chorus]\
You should know I\

[Verse 1]\
Why are you blamin' me for all your insecurities?\
I never did anything, but you closed the door\

You're like a king with a crown lookin' down\
Hopin' I won't eat\

You should've never done somethin' like that to someone\
You can't undo\
Thought you were under the radar\
But under the chaos, I see through\

As long as you swear you won't be piss\uc0\u1077 d when I do it myself\
Let's end it like we should and say we're good\
\
[Verse 2]\
No need to hide it, go get what you want\
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could\
It's time I wave goodbye from the window\
Let's end this like we should and say we're good\
\
[Chorus]\
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change\
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways\
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else\
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself\
Let's end it like we should and say we're good\
[Bridge]\
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would\
I'm trying my best to make this easy\
So don't give me that, just say we're good\
\
[Chorus]\
We're not meant to be, that's never gonna change\
(That's never gonna change)\
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways\
(To go our separate ways, oh)\
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else\

'Running'\

What is all this darkness you have inside?\
I just can't ignore it\
From my heart, words pouring\
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Baby, it's the last time\
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it\
Check it with a flashlight\
It's the last night you'll get up on it\
If you wanna save it, ooh\
Better shoot straight like a laser, ooh\
I ain't waiting for you, you\
\
[Chorus]\
Now I'm running for my life\
Been too many miles\
Tryna find the road to you\
'Cause you, you just wanna drive\
With no place in mind\
Where the hell we going to, oh?\
I'm running, running\
Got me running, running, ooh\
I'm running, running\
Got me running, running, ooh\
[Verse 2]\
Boom, barrel of a gun, pow\
I'll be on the run now\
Can't take no more bullets through my wounds\
I just can't ignore it\
From my heart, words pouring\
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Baby, it's the last time\
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it\
Check it with a flashlight\

So watch it blow when I let it go\
When I cut this rope and run, run\
By the time you wake, it'll be too late\
Now the bullet left the gun, yeah\
\
[Chorus]\
Now I'm running for my life\
Been too many miles\
Tryna find the road to you\
'Cause you, you just wanna drive\
With no place in mind\
Where the hell we going to, oh?\

'For Julian'\
\
\
What would you feel?\
What would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real?\
What would you say?\
What would you say if I told you it's actually gon' be a good day?\
\
[Chorus]\
Maybe all things happen for a reason\
You just need to get over this dry season\
But the only drug you need is believing\
Maybe God does answer all your prayers\
Maybe need to let go of the fear\
Of being let down from the people you keep near\
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear\
Maybe God does answer all your prayers\
\
[Verse 2]\
What do you need?\
What do you need to show you there's better things to life than good weed?\
What do you hear?\
What do you hear?\
What do you hear when I tell you I'm always near?\
I made it pretty clear\
What do you see?\
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free?\
You got a friend in me\
[Chorus]\
Maybe all things happen for a reason\
You just need to get over this dry season\
But the only drug you need is believing\
Maybe God does answer all your prayers\
Maybe need to let go of the fear\
Of being let down from the people you keep near\
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear\
Maybe God does answer all your prayers\
\
[Bridge]\
And I'm still here\
And I'm holding hard onto your hand\
But it still feels\
Like you're never gonna understand\
One can drown alone, but we can swim together\
\
[Chorus]\
Maybe all things happen for a reason\
You just need to get over this dry season\
But the only drug you need is believing\
Maybe God does answer all your prayers\
And let go of the fear\
Of being let down from the people you keep near\

Your beauty is beyond compare\
With flaming locks of auburn hair\
With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green\
Your smile is like a breath of spring\
Your voice is soft like summer rain\
And I cannot compete with you, Jolene\

He talks about you in his sleep\

'9 to 5'\

And yawn and stretch and try to come to life\
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'\
Out on the street, the traffic starts jumpin'\
With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5\
\
[Chorus]\
Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'\
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'\
They just use your mind and they never give you credit\
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it\
9 to 5, for service and devotion\
You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion\
Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me\
I swear sometimes that man is out to get me\
Mmmm\
\
[Verse 2]\
They let you dream just to watch 'em shatter\
You're just a step on the bossman's ladder\
But you've got dreams he'll never take away\
In the same boat with a lot of your friends\
Waitin' for the day your ship'll come in\
And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll your way\
[Chorus]\
Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'\
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'\
They just use your mind and you never get the credit\
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it\
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you\
There's a better life and you think about it don't you\
It's a rich man's game no matter what they call it\
And you spend your life puttin' money in his wallet\
9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'\
Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'\
They just use your mind and they never give you credit\
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it\
9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you\
There's a better life and you think about it don't you\

'Coat of Many Colors'\
\
\
I recall a box of rags that someone gave us\
And how my mama put the rags to use\
\
[Verse 2]\
There were rags of many colors, every piece was small\
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall\
Mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love\
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of\
\
[Verse 3]\
As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible she had read\
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said\
Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness\
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss\
\
[Bridge 1]\
My coat of many colors that my mama made for me\
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly\
Although we had no money I was rich as I could be\
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me\
\
[Verse 4]\
So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes\
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school\
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me\
[Verse 5]\
But they didn't understand it for I felt I was rich\
And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch\
And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed\
And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes\
\
[Bridge 2]\
But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see\
That one is only poor only if they choose to be\
Now I know we had no money but I was rich as I could be\
\
\
\

\
[Verse 2]\
Bittersweet memories\
That's all I am taking with me\
Goodbye, please don't cry\
We both know that I'm not what you need\
\
[Chorus]\
But I will always love you\
I will always love you\
\
[Bridge]\
I hope life treats you kind\
And I hope that you have all\
That you ever dreamed of\
And I wish you joy and happiness\
But above all of this, I wish you love\

Now, I ain't one for speakin' out much\
But that don't mean I don't stay in touch\
Everybody's trippin' over this or that\
What we gonna do when we all fall flat?\
\
[Chorus]\
Liar, liar, the world's on fire\
What we gonna do when it all burns down?\
\
[Verse 2]\
I don't know what to think about us\
When did we lose "In God we trust?"\
God almighty, what we gonna do?\
If God ain't listenin' and we're deaf too\
\
[Chorus]\
Liar, liar, the world's on fire\
What you gonna do when it all burns down?\
Fire, fire, burnin' higher\
Still got time to turn it all around\
[Verse 3]\
Don't get me started on politics\
Now how are we to live in a world like this?\
Greedy politicians, present and past\
They wouldn't know the truth if it bit 'em in the ass\
\
[Interlude]\
(What you gonna do?) Now tell me, what is truth?\
(What you gonna do?) Have we all lost sight\
(What you gonna do?) Of common decency?\
(What you gonna do?) Of wrong and right?\
How do we heal this great divide?\
Do we care enough to try?\
But liar, liar, the world's on fire\
What we gonna do when it all burns down?\
\
[Verse 4]\
Billy got a gun, Joey got a knife\
Janie got a sign to carry in the fight\
Marchin' in the streets with sticks and stones\
Don't you ever believe words don't break bones\
\
[Bridge]\
Oh, can't we rise above?\
Can't we show some love?\
Do we just give up or make a change?\
We know all too well\
We've all been through hell\
Time to break the spell in Heaven's name\
[Chorus]\
Liar, liar, the world's on fire\
What you gonna do when it all burns down?\
Fire, fire, burnin' higher (Fire, fire)\
Still got time to turn it all around\
Liar, liar, the world's on fire\
What you gonna do when it all burns down?\
Fire, fire, burnin' higher\
Still got time to turn it all around\
\
[Outro]\
(Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\
(Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\
Show some love (Fire, fire, the world's on fire)\
(Still got time to turn it all around)\
Let's rise above (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\
Let's make a stand (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\
Let's lend a hand (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\
(Still got time to turn it all around)\
Let's heal the hurt (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\
Let kindness work (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\
Let's be a friend (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\
(What you gonna do when it all burns down?)\
Let hatred end (Liar, liar, the world's on fire)\
(What you gonna do?)\
Liar, liar, the world's on fire\
What you gonna do when it all burns down?\

'Just Because I\'92m a Woman'\
\
\
And I'm sorry that I'm not\
The woman you thought I'd be\
\
[Verse 2]\
Yes, I've made my mistakes\
But listen and understand\
My mistakes are no worse than yours\
Just because I'm a woman\
\
[Verse 3]\
So when you look at me\
Don't feel sorry for yourself\
Just think of all the shame\
You might have brought somebody else\
Just let me tell you this\
Then we'll both know where we stand\
\
[Bridge]\
My mistakes are no worse than yours\
Just because I'm a woman\
\
[Verse 4]\
Now a man will take a good girl\
And he'll ruin her reputation\
But when he wants to marry\
Well, that's a different situation\
[Verse 5]\
He'll just walk off and leave her\
To do the best she can\
While he looks for an angel\
To wear his wedding band\
\
[Verse 6]\
Now I know that I'm no angel\
If that's what you thought you'd found\
I was just the victim of\
A man that lets me down\

'Berry Pie'\

Yoddle-liddy-yum-yum, my, oh my\
He's kinda cute, I'm kinda shy\

Put somethin' in a bowl or somethin' in a pan\
Make him somethin' tart, make him somethin' sweet\
To get to his heart, make somethin' good to eat\
\
I like to cook, and I love to bake\
Bread and cooki\uc0\u1077 s and pies and cake\

As sweet as his kiss\
I wanna impress him, so why don't I\
Just show him my love in a berry pie?\
\
Berry pie, a berry pie\
I'm gonna make him a berry pie\
He's the berries, so why don't I\

'Here You Come Again'\
\
\
You waltz right in the door\
Just like you've done before\
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger\
\
[Verse 2]\
Here you come again\
Just when I'm about to make it work without you\
You look into my eyes\
And lie those pretty lies\
And pretty soon I'm wondering' how I came to doubt you\
\
[Chorus]\
All you got to do is smile that smile\
And there go all my defenses\
Just leave it up to you and in a little while\
You're messing' up my mind and filling' up my senses\
\
[Verse 3]\
Here you come again\
Looking' better than a body has a right to\
And shaking' me up so that all I really know\
Is here you come again\
And here I go\
[Instrumental Interlude]\

And here I go\
Here you come again\
And here I go\

'Cracker Jack'\
\
\
His legs were way too long and he was awkward as could be\
He wasn't much to look at but he looked alright to me\
I found him by the river bank just wandering about\
He was cold and hungry and his ribs were sticking out\
I snapped my fingers, whistled, when he came, I picked him up\
I was just a kid and Cracker Jack was just a pup\
I took him home and fed him 'til he couldn't eat no more\
I took him to my room and put a blanket on the floor\
After that beside my bed is where he'd always sleep\
Each night in my prayers I'd pray the lord his soul to keep\
\
[Chorus]\
Cracker Jack\
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack\
But he was more than that\
A playmate, a companion\
He was love and understanding\
That was Cracker Jack\
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack\
But he was more than that\
Everything a kid could want I had in Cracker Jack\
\
[Verse 2]\
Cracker Jack would run to meet me after school each day\
He'd jump and wag his tail and look at me as if to say\
"I love you and I've missed you and I'm glad you're home again"\
I knew just how he felt 'cause me and Cracker Jack was friends\
Through the woods and fields we would often roam about\
And when we got in trouble we would help each other out\
I could run almost as fast as Cracker Jack could run\
We had a lot in common and we had a lot of fun\
He was always with me when I was growing up\
We shared each other's good times and we shared each other's love\
He only lives in memories now but often I think back\
To the days of childhood, the days of Cracker Jack\
[Chorus]\
Cracker Jack\
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack\
But he was more than that\
A playmate, a companion\
He was love and understanding\
That was Cracker Jack\
The best friend that I ever had was Cracker Jack\

'Hard Candy Christmas'\
\
\
Maybe I'll get a car\
Maybe I'll drive so far\
They'll all lose track\
Me, I'll bounce right back\
Maybe I'll sleep real late\
Maybe I'll lose some weight\
Maybe I'll clear my junk\
Maybe I'll just get drunk on apple wine\
Me, I'll be just\
\
[Chorus]\
Fine and dandy\
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas\
I'm barely getting through tomorrow\
But still I won't let\
Sorrow bring me way down\
I'll be fine and dandy\
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas\
I'm barely getting through tomorrow\
But still I won't let\
Sorrow bring me way down\
\
[Verse 2]\
Hey, maybe I'll learn to sew\
Maybe I'll just lie low\
Maybe I'll hit the bars\
Maybe I'll count the stars until dawn\
Me, I will go on\
Maybe I'll settle down\
Maybe I'll just leave town\
Maybe I'll have some fun\
Maybe I'll meet someone\
And make him mine\
Me, I'll be just\
\
[Chorus]\
Fine and dandy\
Lord it's like a hard candy Christmas\
I'm barely getting through tomorrow\
But still I won't let\
Sorrow bring me way down\

But still I won't let\

But still I won't let\
Sorrow bring me way down\

'Two Doors Down'\
\
\
But I here I am crying my heart out, feeling sorry\
They're having a party two doors down\
\
[Verse 1]\
I think I'll dry these useless tears and get myself together\
I think I'll wander down the hall and have a look around\
'Cause I can't stay inside this lonely room and cry forever\
I think I'd really rather join 'em two door down, yeah\
\
[Chorus]\
Two doors down, they're laughin' and drinkin' and having a party\
Two doors down, they're not aware that I'm around\
Here I am, no longer crying and feeling sorry\
They're having a party two doors down\
\
[Verse 2]\
I can't believe I'm standing here, dry-eyed, all smiles and talking\
Making conversation with the new love I have found\
I asked him if he'd like to be alone and we start walkin'\
Down the hall to my place waiting two doors down, yeah\
\
[Chorus]\
Two doors down, they're laughin' and drinkin' and having a party\
Two doors town, we're not aware that they're around\
But I here I am feeling everything but sorry\
We're having our own party two doors down\
[Breakdown]\
Oh, oh, oh\
Oh, two doors down\
Oh, oh, oh\
Oh, two doors down\
Oh, oh, oh\
Oh, two doors down\
Oh, oh, oh\
Oh, two doors down, oh\
\
[Chorus]\
Two doors down, they're laughin' and drinkin' and having a party\
Two doors down, we're not aware that they're around\
Here we are feelin' everything but sorry\
We're having our own party two doors down, yeah\
Two doors down, they're laughin' and drinkin' and having a party\
Two doors down, we're not aware that they're around\

'Girl in the Movies'\
\
\
Best seat in my favorite movie house\
Start my dreaming as the lights go out\
Up on the silver screen, I picture me\
Living out my passions, hopes, and fantasies\
\
[Chorus 1]\
I want to be the girl in the movies\
The one with the glint in her eyes\
The girl that seldom loses\
Beautiful, with grace and style\
Acting out her story\
Standing in her glory\
Happy ever after\
I want to be the girl in the movies\
\
[Verse 2]\
Wish I had a nickel for each dime I've spent\
Watching others live their lives with confidence\
Here's a preview of some things to come\
It's not too late for me to be someone\
I can't keep living in their make-believe\
Coming attractions will be starring me\
[Chorus 2]\
I want to be the girl in the movies\
The one with the stars in her eyes (In her eyes)\
She gets the roles she chooses\
She can laugh or she can cry\
Acting in her story\
Standing in her glory\
Always happy endings\
I want to be the girl in the movies\
\
[Bridge]\
It's time I show the world just what I'm about\
I'm steppin' up and I'm steppin' out\
I'm feelin' bold and I'm feelin' proud\
I want to be that girl\
\
[Chorus 3]\
I want to be the girl in the movies\
Hmm hmm\
I want to be the girl in the movies\
Hmm hmm hmm\
\
[Verse 3]\
Gonna stand up\
And I'm gonna matter\
'Cause I've had enough of my dreams being shattered\
And I've had enough of my tears being splattered\
I've already been that girl\
[Outro]\
Oh, I want to be (I want to be)\
I want to be (I want to be)\
I want to be the girl in the movies\
I want to be (I want to be)\
Hey look at me (Hey look at me)\
I want to be the girl in the movies\
I want to shine (I want to shine)\
I want to shine (I'm gonna shine)\
It's my time\
And I want to shine\

'Dumb Blonde'\
\
\
Don't try to make me feel sorry for you\
Just because I'm blonde\
Don't think I'm dumb\
'Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
When you left you thought I'd sit\
And you thought I'd wait\
And you thought I'd cry\
You called me a dumb blonde (Dumb blonde)\
Ah, but somehow I lived through it\
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned\
Blondes have more fun\
\
[Chorus]\
You flew too high up off the ground\
It's stormy weather and had to come back down\
But I've found new thread for my old spool\
Just because I'm blonde\
Don't think I'm dumb\
'Cause this dumb blonde ain't nobody's fool\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
When you left you thought I'd sit\
And you thought I'd wait\
And you thought I'd cry\
You called me a dumb blonde\
Ah, but somehow I lived through it\
And you know if there's one thing this blonde has learned\
Blondes have more fun\
[Chorus]\
You flew too high up off the ground\
It's stormy weather and had to come back down\
But I've found new thread for my old spool\
Just because I'm blonde\

'The Bridge'\
\
\
Here is where it started\
On the bridge\
The moon is big and yellow\
And the stars are all a' glow\
From the bridge, I see reflections\
In the waters far below\
\
[Verse 2]\
You kissed me for the first time here\
An' held me awfully tight\
And the bridge became our favorite place\
We came here often in the night\
\
[Verse 3]\
And one night while standing on the bridge\
Desire swept through us both\
Passion took us by the hand\
And showed us where to go\
\
[Verse 4]\
From the bridge we saw a meadow\
So we ran together there\
Where we found love together\
Our emotions filled the air\
[Bridge]\
The bridge, so wide\
The bridge, so long\
Where once we stood together\
Tonight I stand alone\
\
[Verse 5]\
Tonight, while standing on the bridge\
My heart is beating wild\
To think that you could leave me here\
With our unborn child\
\
[Verse 6]\
My feet are moving slowly\
Closer to the edge\
\
\
\
'Me and Little Andy'\
\
\
I wondered who could be outside in such an awful storm\
And then I saw a little girl with a puppy in her arms\
Before I could say a word she said, "My name is Sandy\
And this here is my puppy dog, its name is little Andy"\
Standing in the bitter cold in just a ragged dress\
Then I asked her to come in and this is what she said\
\
[Chorus]\
"Ain't ya got no gingerbread? Ain't ya got no candy?\
Ain't you got an extra bed for me and little Andy?\
Patty cake and bakersman, my mommy ran away again\
And we was all alone and didn't know what else to do\
I wonder if you'll let us stay with you?"\
\
[Verse 2]\
Giddy up trotty horse, going to the mill\
Can we stay all night?\
If you don't love us, no one will\
I promise we won't cry\
London Bridge is falling down\
My daddy's drunk again in town\
And we was all alone and didn't know what we could do\
We wondered if you'd let us stay with you?\
[Bridge]\
She was just a little girl, not more than six or seven\
But that night as they slept, the angels took them both to heaven\
God knew little Andy would be lonesome with her gone\
Now Sandy and her puppy dog won't ever be alone\
\
[Chorus]\
\
\
\
'Why\'92d You Come in Here Lookin\'92 Like That'\
\
\
Why'd you come in here looking like that?\
\
Here comes my baby dragging my heart behind\
He's drivin' me crazy, who says love is blind?\
He's got a wandering eye and a traveling mind\
Big ideas and a little behind\
Out with a different woman every night\
But I remember when he was mine\
\
Why'd you come in here looking like that?\
In your high heeled boots and your painted-on jeans\
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream\
Waltzing right in here lookin' like that\
Why'd you come in here looking like that?\
When you could stop traffic in a gunny sack\
Why, you're almost giving me a heart attack\
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that\
\
I just can't stand it to see him on the town\
He's out slow dancing with every girl around\
I'm a soft-hearted woman, he's a hardheaded man\
And he's gonna make me feel just as bad as he can\
He's got himself a mean streak a half a mile wide\
But now he's dancing on this heart of mine\
Why'd you come in here looking like that?\
In your high heel boots and your painted-on jeans\
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream\
Why'd you come in here looking like that?\
\
Why'd you come in here looking like that?\
In your cowboy boots and your painted-on jeans\
All decked out like a cowgirl's dream\
Why'd you come in here looking like that?\
Why'd you come in here looking like that?\
When you could stop traffic in a gunny sack\
Why, you're almost giving me a heart attack\
When you waltz right in here lookin' like that\

'Do I Ever Cross Your Mind'\
\
\
And the flowers still grow, but they don't smell as sweet\
As they did when you picked them for me\
\
[Chorus]\
And when I think of you and the love we once knew\
How I wish we could go back in time\
Do you ever think back on old memories like that\
Or do I ever cross your mind?\
\
[Bridge]\
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you miss me\
Do you, darling?\
Oh, and do your memories ever take\
You back into another place in time?\
Oh, and do you ever miss the feelings and the love we shared when you were with me\
Do you, darling?\
I just wonder, do I cross your mind?\
\
[Verse 2]\
Oh, how often I wish that again I could kiss your sweet lips like I did long ago\
And how often I long for those two lovin' arms that once held me so gentle and close\
\
[Chorus]\
And when I think of you and the love we once knew, how I wish we could go back in time\
Do you ever recall these old memories at all, or do I ever cross your mind?\
[Bridge]\
Do you ever wake up lonely in the middle of the night because you miss me, do you darling?\
Oh, and do your memories ever take\
You back into another place in time?\
Oh, and do you ever miss the feeling and the love we shared when you were with me, do you darling?\
I just wonder, do I cross your mind?\
\
[Outro]\
Or do I ever cross your mind?\
\
Tell me, do I ever?\
Do I?\
Do I ever?\
Do I?\
Do I ever cross your mind?\
\
Darling, do I ever?\
Do I?\
Do I ever?\
Do I?\
Do I ever cross your mind?\
\
Tell me, do I ever?\
Do I?\
Do I ever?\

'Little Sparrow'\
\
\
Little sparrow, little sparrow\
Flies so high and feels no pain\
\
[Verse 1]\
All ye maidens, heed my warning\
Never trust the hearts of men\
They will crush you like a sparrow\
Leaving you to never mend\
They will vow to always love you\
Swear no love but yours will do\
Then they'll leave you for another\
Break your little heart in two\
\
[Chorus]\
Little sparrow, little sparrow\
Precious fragile little thing\
Little sparrow, little sparrow\
Flies so high and feels no pain\
\
[Verse 2]\
If I were a little sparrow\
Over these mountains I would fly\
I would find him, I would find him\
Look into his lying eyes\
I would flutter all around him\
On my little sparrow wings\
I would ask him, I would ask him\
Why he let me love in vain\
I am not a little sparrow\
I am just the broken dream\
Of a cold false-hearted lover\
And his evil cunning scheme\
[Chorus]\
Little sparrow, little sparrow\
Precious fragile little thing\
Little sparrow, little sparrow\
Flies so high and feels no pain\
All ye maidens fair and tender\
Never trust the hearts of men\
They will crush you like a sparrow\
Leaving you to never mend\
\
[Outro]\
\
\
\
'Here I Am'\
\
\
Need someone to stand by you\
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am\
If you need a helping hand, need someone to understand\
Here I am, oh here I am, here I am\
\
[Chorus]\
Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without\
I can help you find what you've been looking for\
Here I am, come to me, take my hand because I believe\
I can give you all the love you need and more\
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am\
\
[Verse 2]\
My world is such an empty place\
I need someone to fill the space\
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am\
Because I've got so much love to give\
I need someone to share it with\
And here I am, oh here I am, here I am\
\
[Chorus]\
Here I am, I'm reaching out to give you love that you're without\
I can help you find what you've been looking for\
Here I am, come to me, take my hand because I believe\
I can give you all the love you need and more\
Oh here I am, oh here I am, here I am\

\
'Old Flames (Can\'92t Hold a Candle to You)'\
\
\
I caught a spark from his eyes of forgotten desire\
With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire\
\
[Chorus]\
Old flames can't hold a candle to you\
No one can light up the night like you do\
Flickering embers of love, I've known one or two\
Old flames can't hold a candle to you\
\
[Verse 2]\
Sometimes at night I think of old lovers I've known\
I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone\
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone\
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn\
\
[Chorus]\
Old flames can't hold a candle to you\
No one can light up the night like you do\
\
\
\
'Love Is Like a Butterfly'\
\
\
Love makes your heart feel strange inside, it flutters like soft wings in flight\
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing\
\
[Verse 1]\
I feel it when you're with me, it happens when you kiss me\
That rare and gentle feeling that I feel inside\
Your touch is soft and gentle, your kiss is warm and tender\
Whenever I am with you I think of butterflies\
\
[Chorus]\
Love is like a butterfly, as soft and gentle as a sigh\
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings\
Love makes your heart feel strange inside, it flutters like soft wings in flight\
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing\
\
[Verse 2]\
Your laughter brings me sunshine, every day is springtime\
And I am only happy when you are by my side\
How precious is this love we share, how very precious, sweet and rare\
Together we belong like daffodils and butterflies\
\
[Chorus]\
Love is like a butterfly, as soft and gentle as a sigh\
The multicolored moods of love are like its satin wings\
Love makes your heart feel strange inside, it flutters like soft wings in flight\
Love is like a butterfly, a rare and gentle thing\
\
\
\
'Light of a Clear Blue Morning'\
\
\
But I see a brand new day dawning\
I've been looking for the sunshine\
You know I ain't seen it in so long\
But everything's gonna work out just fine\
And everything's gonna be all right\
That's been all wrong\
\
'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning\
I can see the light of a brand new day\
I can see the light of a clear blue morning\
Oh and everything's gonna be all right\
It's gonna be okay\
\
It's been a long long time\
Since I've known the taste of freedom\
And those clinging vines\
That had me bound, well I don't need 'em\
I've been like a captured eagle\
You know an eagle is born to fly\
Now that I have won my freedom\
Like an eagle, I am eager to fly\
\
'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning\
I can see the light of a brand new day\
I can see the light of a clear blue morning\
Oh and everything's gonna be all right\
It's gonna be okay\
I can see the light of a clear blue morning\
I can see the light of a brand new day\
I can see the light of a clear blue morning\
Oh and everything's gonna be all right\
Everything's gonna be all right\
Everything's gonna be all right\
It's gonna be ok\
\
'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning\
I can see the light of a brand new day\
I can see the light of a clear blue morning\
And everything's gonna be all right\
Everything's gonna be all right\
Everything's gonna be all right\
It's gonna be okay\
\
'Cause I can see the light of a clear blue morning\
I can see the light of a brand new day\
I can see the light of a clear blue morning\
And everything's gonna be all right\
Everything's gonna be all right\

\
'Silver and Gold'\
\
\
And I stopped to help him and lend him a hand\
He said, I love you so much, but you must understand\
\
[Chorus]\
Silver and gold might buy you a home\
But things of this world, they won't last you long\
And time has a way of turning us old\
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold\
\
[Verse 2]\
And he said to me, let's rest for awhile\
For I have some good news to share with you, child\
He said, you can't change this old world\
The people need to know that a dear savior died here\
A long, long time ago\
\
[Chorus]\
And silver and gold might buy you a home\
But things of this world, they won't last you long\
And time has a way of turning us old\
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold\
\
[Verse 3]\
His eyes shown like diamonds and his smile was heaven sent\
His hair was long and flowing and his back was slightly bent\
And I knew he knew it, 'cause that day I changed\
As I watched him walk on, I forgot to get his name\
[Chorus]\
He said silver and gold can't buy you a home\
When this life has ended and your time has gone\
But you can live in a world where you never grow old\
And things can't be bought there with silver and gold\
\
\
\
'Backwoods Barbie'\
\
\
Like Barbie or the models in the Fredricks catalog\
From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm just a Backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair\
Don't be fooled by thinking that the goods are not all there\
Don't let these false eyelashes lead you to believe that\
I'm as shallow as I look cause I run true and deep\
\
[Verse 2]\
I've always been misunderstood because of how I look\
Don't judge me by the cover cause I'm a real good book\
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am\
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam\
\
[Chorus]\
I'm just a Backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels\
I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real\
And I'm all dolled up and hoping for a chance to prove my worth\
And even Backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt\
\
[Interlude]\
[Chorus]\
I'm just a Backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair\
Don't be fooled by thinking that the goods are not all there\
Yes, I can see where I could be misjudged upon first glance\
But even Backwoods Barbie's deserve a second chance\
\
\
\
'Joshua'\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
Well, a good ways down the railroad track\
There was this little old rundown shack\
And in it lived a man I'd never seen\
Folks said he was a mean and a vicious man\
And you better not set foot on his land\
But I didn't think nobody could be that mean\
So I took me out walkin' down the railroad track\
I was a-gonna go down to that little old shack\
And just find out if all them things I'd heard was true\
There was a big black dog layin' out in the yard\
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard\
And I heard somebody say, "Well, who are you?"\
Oh, and there he stood in the door of that shack\
And his beard and his hair was long and black\
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen\
When he spoke, his voice was low and deep\
But he just didn't frighten me\
'Cause somehow I just knew he wasn't mean\
He said, "What you doin' snoopin' around my place?"\
And I saw a smile come across his face\
So I smiled back and I told him who I was\
He said, "Come on in and pull you up a chair\
You might as well since you're already here"\
And he said, "You can call me Joshua"\
[Chorus]\
Joshua, Joshua\
What you doin' livin' here all alone?\
Joshua, Joshua\
Ain't you got nobody to call your own?\
No, no, no, no\
\
[Verse 2]\
We talked 'til the sun was clean out of sight\
And we still talkin' when it come daylight\
There was just so much we had to say, hey\
I'd spent my life in an orphan's home\
And just like him, I was all alone\
So I said yeah when he asked if I'd stay\
Oh, we grew closer as time went on\
And that little old shack, it was a happy home\
And we just couldn't help but fall in love\
That big black dog and that little old shack\
Sittin' down by the railroad track\
It's plenty good enough for me and Joshua\
\
[Chorus]\
Joshua, Joshua\
Why, you're just what I've been lookin' for\
Joshua, Joshua\
You ain't gonna be lonesome anymore\
No, no\
[Outro]\
Yodel-e-odel-e, hey, del-e-hee\
Ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-ba, ba-ba-da\
Me and Joshua\
Me and Joshua\
\
\
\
'Red Shoes'\
\
\
'Bout some red shoes that my aunt Lucy wore\
She would let me stomp around\
In those high heels up and down\
'Round the house and 'round the wraparound porch\
\
[Chorus 1]\
And from that moment on\
I've had a pair of my own\
They make me feel at home and brand new\
They build my confidence\
As if they've been heaven sent\
I feel alone, I'm puttin' on my red shoes\
\
[Verse 2]\
I begged mama, "Pretty please\
From the wishbook order me\
A pair of red shoes for my feet", so mama did\
Through the years I've thought about\
Aunt Lucy's love and think of how\
Such little things in life can make or break a kid\
\
[Chorus 2]\
I believe that every child\
Needs to feel a sense of pride\
And someone to love and guide and see them through\
So many miles I've traveled\
Many times they've come unraveled\
On the road both smooth or gravel\
But I've made it through, ooh\
[Bridge]\
Hell and half of Georgia\
Or walkin' through New Orleans\
Walk the streets of Memphis bowlin'\
Stroll around a block or two\
And if God sees fit to hold me\
Anyone that's ever known me\
Know I'd walk the gold streets only\
In a pair of red shoes\
\
[Outro]\
And if I ever get to heaven\
If I ever get to heaven\
If I ever get to heaven\
And Lord I hope I do\
I will walk the streets of glory\
I will walk the streets of glory\
\
\
\
'Don\'92t Make Me Have To Come Down There'\
\
\
Looking down, around in such dismay\
And in my dream I heard him say\
\
[Chorus]\
"Don't make me have to come down there\
My children, you had best beware\
If you don't pay attention, consequences will be dire\
Don't make me have to come down there"\
\
[Verse 2]\
I've told you time and time again\
You can't disobey and hope to win\
I am still the boss here, in case there's any doubt\
You know I put you in this world, and I can take you out\
\
[Chorus]\
Don't make me have to come down there\
You've always been my cross to bear\
I've let you try my patience as all good fathers do\
You're on my last nerve, I have had it up to here with you\
\
[Verse 3]\
I gave you a book, you didn't read it (You didn't read it)\
I gave you my word, you didn't heed it (You didn't heed it)\
Gave you a map, you said you didn't need it (You didn't need it)\
And now you've lost direction, and you're wandering aimlessly\
[Chorus]\
Don't make me have to come down there (Don't make me)\
This is not a game of truth or dare (Don't make me)\
Now, I don't want to punish you, but if it has to be\
This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me\
\
[Chorus 4]\
Don't make me have to come down there\
Bridge this great divide and make repairs\
Go to your room and pray 'til you can learn to play fair\
Don't make me have to come down there (Come down there)\
\
[Bridge]\
Politics, earthquakes, erratic weather\
Pandemics, war, and hate, still, you'd rather\
Turn a deaf ear, a blind eye; I am wondering whether\
I should take my Bible belt and whip you into shape\
\
[Chorus]\
Don't make me have to come down there (Don't make me)\
My children, you had best beware (Don't make me)\
Clean up this mess and put on something decent to wear\
Don't make me have to come down there (Don't make me have to come down there)\
\
[Chorus]\
Don't make me have to come down there\
My children, you had best beware (Don't make me)\
Why can't you learn to listen and learn to love and share?\
Don't make me have to come down there\
[Outro]\
Don't make me have to come down there\
Don't make me come down there\
Don't make me have to come down there\
Don't make me, don't make me\
Don't make me have to come down there\
Don't make me have to come down there\
Don't make me come down there\
Don't make me have to come down there\

'When Life Is Good Again'\
\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
When life is good again\
I'll be a better friend\
A bigger person when\
Life is\uc0\u8197 good\u8197 again\
More thoughtful than\uc0\u8197 I've been\
I'll be so different then\
More\uc0\u8197 in the moment when\
Life is good again\
\
[Chorus]\
I'll open up my heart\
And let the whole world in\
I'll try to make amends\
When life is good again\
\
[Verse 2]\
We've been brought to our knees\
We've been so ill at ease\
There are no guarantees\
But you know life goes on\
This too shall pass away\
Bring new and different days\
We need to change our ways\
And right our wrongs\
[Chorus]\
Let's open up our hearts\
And let the whole world in\
Let's try to make amends\
When life is good again\
I'll open up my doors again\
And hear the message in the wind\
Repent of all my sins (Hallelujah)\
When life is good again\
\
[Bridge]\
I'll try to be someone\
On which you can depend\
A helping hand to lend\
Let's open up our eyes\
And see what's goin' on\
If we're to move along\
From where we've been\
\
[Chorus]\
Let's open up our hearts\
And let the love shine in (Shine in)\
We've all got knees to bend\
And we'll just pray 'til then\
Ask God's forgiveness when\
Life is good again\
[Post-Chorus]\
And it's gonna be good again\
(It's gonna be, it's gonna be)\
It's gonna be good again\
It'll be alright (It'll be alright)\
\
[Outro]\
God's the reason for all things\
You want rainbows, you get rain\
We'll all be forever changed (Forever changed)\
I'll sell my boat and fly my kite\
Walk in the park, go out at night\
And hold my loved ones extra tight\
When everything is on the mend\
I'll even drink with my old friends\
Sing and play my mandolin\
We'll make it through this long dark night\
Darkness fades when faced with light\
\
\
\
'Eagle When She Flies'\
\
\
She's a woman\
She knows how to dish it out or take it all\
Her heart's as soft as feathers\
Still she weathers stormy skies\
And she's a sparrow when she's broken\
But she's an eagle when she flies\
\
[Verse 2]\
A kaleidoscope of colors\
You can toss her round and round\
You can keep her in your vision\
But you'll never keep her down\
She's a lover, she's a mother\
She's a friend and she's a wife\
And she's a sparrow when she's broken\
But she's an eagle when she flies\
\
[Verse 3]\
Gentle as the sweet magnolia\
Strong as steel, her faith and pride\
She's an everlasting shoulder\
She's the leaning post of life\
She hurts deep and when she weeps\
She's just as fragile as a child\
And she's a sparrow when she's broken\
But she's an eagle when she flies\
[Outro]\
She's a sparrow when she's broken\
But she's an eagle when she flies\
\

\
'My Tennessee Mountain Home'\
\
\
Watch the kids a-playing with June bugs on a string\
And chase the glowing fireflies when evening shadows fall\
\
[Chorus]\
In my Tennessee mountain home\
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh\
In my Tennessee mountain home\
Crickets sing in the fields nearby\
\
[Verse 2]\
Honeysuckle vine clings to the fence along the lane\
Their fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet\
And on a distant hilltop, an eagle spreads its wings\
And a songbird on a fencepost sings a melody\
\
[Chorus]\
In my Tennessee mountain home\
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh\
In my Tennessee mountain home\
Crickets sing in the field nearby\
\
[Instrumental Break]\
[Verse 3]\
Walking home from church on Sunday with the one ya love\
Just laughing, talking, making future plans\
And when the folks ain't looking, you might steal a kiss or two\
Sitting in the porch swing, holding hands\
\
[Chorus]\
In my Tennessee mountain home\
Life is as peaceful as a baby's sigh\
\
\
\
'The Bargain Store'\
\
\
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used\
But with a little mending, it could be as good as new\
\
[Verse 2]\
Why, you take, for instance, this old broken heart\
If you will just replace the missing parts\
You would be surprised to find how good it really is\
Take it and you never will be sorry that you did\
\
[Chorus]\
The bargain store is open, come inside (The bargain store is open, come inside)\
You can easily afford the price (The bargain store is open, come inside)\
Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise\
And I can guarantee you'll be completely satisfied (The bargain store is open, come inside)\
\
[Verse 3]\
Take these old, used memories from the past\
And these broken dreams and plans that didn't last\
I'll trade them for a future, I can't use them anymore\
I've wasted love, but I still have some more\
\
[Chorus]\
The bargain store is open, come inside\
You can easily afford the price\
Love is all you need to purchase all the merchandise\
And I can guarantee you'll be completely satisfied\
[Verse 1]\
My life is like unto a bargain store\
And I may have just what you're looking for\
If you don't mind the fact that all the merchandise is used\
But with a little mending, it could be as good as new\
\
[Outro]\
The bargain store is open, come inside (The bargain store is open, come inside)\
\

'5 to 9'\
\
\
Yawn and stretch and try to come to life\
Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumping\
Out\uc0\u8287 on\u8287 the\u8287 streets, the traffic\u8287 starts jumping\
With folks\uc0\u8287 like me on the job from nine to five\
\
[Chorus]\
Working nine to five, what a way to make a living\
Barely getting by, it's all taking and no giving\
They just use your mind and they never give you credit\
It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it\
Working five to nine, you've got passion and a vision\
'Cause it's hustlin' time, a whole new way to mak\uc0\u1077  a livin'\
Gonna change your life, do something that giv\uc0\u1077 s it meaning\
With a website that is worthy of your dreaming\
\
[Verse 2]\
Well, you've got dreams and you know they matter\
Be your own boss, climb your own ladder\
That moment's getting closer by the day\
And you're in the same boat with a lotta your friends\
Launching ideas you all believe in\
The tide's gonna turn and it's all gonna roll your way\
[Chorus]\
Working five to nine, makin' something of your own now\
And it feels so fine to build a business from your know-how\
Gonna move ahead, and there's nothin' that you can't do\
When you listen to that little voice inside you, yeah\
Five to nine, you've got passion and a vision\
'Cause it's hustlin' time, a whole new way to make a livin'\
Gonna change your life, do something that gives it meaning\
With a website that is worthy of your dreaming\
\

Five to nine\
You keep workin' workin' workin'\
Workin' five to nine\
'Til your dreams come true\
Workin' five to nine\
You keep dreamin' dreamin' dreamin'\

\
'Hello God'\
\
\
Hello God, if we're still on speaking terms\
Can you help me like before?\
I have questioned your existence\
My resistance leaves me cold\
Can you help me go the distance?\
Hello God, hello, hello?\
\
[Verse 1]\
This old world has gone to pieces\
Can we fix it, is there time?\
Hate and violence just increases\
We're so selfish, cruel and blind\
We fight and kill each other\
In your name, defending you\
Do you love some more than others?\
We're so lost and confused\
\
[Chorus 2]\
Hello God, are you out there?\
Can you hear us, are you listening anymore?\
Hello God, if we're still on speaking terms\
Can you help us like before?\
Oh, the free will you have given\
We have made a mockery of\
This is no way to be living\
We're in great need of your love\
[Refrain]\
Hello God\
\
[Chorus 3]\
Hello God, can you grant us\
Love enough to make amends?\
Hello God, is there still a chance\
That we could start again?\
Hello God, we've learned our lesson\
Dear God, don't let us go\
More than ever\
Hello God, hello, hello\
\
[Chorus 4]\
Hello God, we really need you\
We can't make it without you\
Hello God, we beseech you\
In the name of all that's true\
Hello God, please forgive us\
For we know not what we do\
\

'When Someone Wants to Leave'\
\
\
And you want to keep them with you\
But you know they want to go\
What do you do? What do you say?\
When you know they want to leave\
As bad as you want them to stay\
\
[Chorus]\
And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love\
When one doesn't care at all and the other cares too much\
It's a sad situation, I must say\
When someone wants to leave\
As bad as you want them to stay\
\
[Verse 2]\
You know how much I love you\
But I know you don't love me\
And I know it's just a matter of time before you leave\
But I, do I stand aside and just let you walk away?\
But I know you want to leave\
As bad as I want you to stay\
\
[Chorus]\
And there's nothing quite as sad as a one-sided love\
When one doesn't love at all and the other loves too much\
It's a sad situation I must say\
When someone wants to leave as bad as you want them to stay\
\
\
\
'Lonely Comin\'92 Down'\
\
\
Then I looked for you, but you could not be found\
And then I felt the lonely coming down\
\
[Verse 2]\
I walked across the room to the empty bed\
Saw the imprint on the pillow where you laid your head\
The presence of you still lingered all around\
And once again I felt the lonely coming down\
\
[Verse 3]\
Then I felt the lonely dripping down my face\
As I realized no one could take your place\
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found\
And then again I felt the lonely coming down\
\
[Outro]\
\
\
\
'The House of the Rising Sun'\
\
\
A house they call the Rising Sun\
Where love and money are made\
\
[Verse 2]\
My father, he was a gambler\
Mother died when I was young\
And I've worked since then to pleasure the men\
At the House of the Rising Sun\
\
[Verse 3]\
There is a house in New Orleans\
They call the Rising Sun\
It's been the ruin of many a good girl\
And oh God, you know I'm one\
\
[Verse 4]\
So mothers, you go telling all your daughters\
Not to do what I have done\
To live a life of sin, shame and strife\
In the House of the Rising Sun\
\
[Verse 5]\
There is a house down in New Orleans\
They call the Rising Sun\
It's been the ruin of many a good girl\
\
\
\
'The Grass Is Blue'\
\
\
I just can't make it one day without you\
Unless I pretend that the opposite's true\
\
[Chorus]\
Rivers flow backwards\
Valleys are high\
Mountains are level\
Truth is alive\
I'm perfectly fine\
And I don't miss you\
The sky is green\
And the grass is blue\
\
[Verse 2]\
How much can a heart and a troubled mind take\
Where is that fine line before it all breaks?\
Can one in their sorrow, just cross over it\
And into that realm of insanity's bliss?\
\
[Chorus]\
There's snow in the tropics\
There's ice on the sun\
It's hot in the Arctic\
And crying is fun\
And I'm happy now\
And I'm glad we're through\
And the sky is green\
And the grass is blue\
And the rivers flow backwards\
And my tears are dry\
Swans hate the water\
And eagles can't fly\
But I'm alright now\
Now that I'm over you\
And the sky is green\
And the grass is blue\
[Outro]\
\
\
\
'Family'\
\
\
When it's family, you accept them\
'Cause you have no choice but to\
When it's family, they're a mirror\
Of the worst and best in you\
And they always put you to the test\
And you always try to do your best\
And just pray for God to do the rest\
When it's family\
\
[Verse 2]\
Some are preachers, some are gay\
Some are addicts, drunks, and strays\
But not a one is turned away when it's family\
Some are lucky, others ain't\
Some are fighters, others faint\
Winners, losers, sinners, saints\
It's all family\
\
[Verse 3]\
And when it's family, you trust them\
And your heart's an open door\
When it's family\
You tolerate what you'd kill others for\
When it's family, you love and hate and take\
Then give some more\
Somehow you justify mistakes\
Try to find some better way\
To solve the problems day to day\
In the family\
[Verse 4]\
You take the trouble as it comes\
And love 'em more than anyone\
Good or bad or indifferent, it's still family\
You choose your lovers\
You pick your friends\
But not the family that you're in, no\
They'll be with you 'til the end\
'Cause it's family\
\
[Verse 5]\
When it's family, you forgive them\
For they know not what they do\
When it's family\
They're a mirror of the worst and best in you\
When it's family\
\
\
\
'Down from Dover'\
\
\
By the time it was revealing\
The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow\
Over the fields of clover\
And time is running out for me I wish\
That he would hurry down from Dover\
\
He's been gone so long\
When he left the snow was deep upon the ground\
And I have seen a spring and summer pass\
And now the leaves are turning brown\
And any time a tiny face will show itself\
Because waiting's almost over\
But I won't have a name to give\
It if he doesn't hurry down from Dover\
From Dover, from Dover\
\
My folks weren't understanding when they found out\
They sent me from the home place\
My daddy said if folks found out\
He'd be ashamed to ever show his face\
My mamma said I was a fool\
And she did not believe it when I told her\
That everything would be all right\
Because soon he would be coming down from Dover\
I found a place to stay out\
On a farm takin' care of that old lady\
She never asked me nuthin'\
So I never talked to her about my baby\
I sent a message to my mom\
With a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover\
And to make sure he got that information\
When he came down from Dover\
\
I loved him more than anything\
And I could not refuse him when he needed me\
He was the only one I'd loved\
And I just can't believe that he was using me\
He couldn't leave me here like this\
I know it can't be so, it can't be over\
He wouldn't make me go through this alone\
Oh he'll be coming down from Dover\
\
My body aches the time is here\
It's lonely in this place where I'm lying\
Our baby has been born but something's wrong\
It's much too still I hear no crying\
I guess in some strange way she knew\
She'd never have a father's arms to hold her\
\

Could I use you for awhile?\
It's all wrong, but it's all right\

The amber sunset glow has died\
My needs are very much alive\
Is it okay if I stop by?\
It's all wrong, but it's all right\

It's all wrong, but it's all right\
Just close your eyes and hold me tight\
Tell me sexy loving lines\
It's all wrong, but it's all right\

But I just need someone so much\
And who knows? It might last for life\
It's all wrong, but it's all right\

'Gonna Hurry (As Slow As I Can)'\
\
\
I know I can't stay\
\
You tell me that I must go\
I'll try to understand\
Well, I'm gonna leave you\
And I'm gonna hurry just\
Just as slow as I can\
\
Well, I'm gonna cry, cry myself\
Cry myself to death\
Just crying, crying over you\
Well I, I feel sorry, so sorry for myself\
But I, I've got to leave, I know it's true\
\
Oh, oh the little ring you gave to me\
I took it, took it from my hands\
'Cause I'm gonna leave you\

'Lovin\'92 You (2016)'\
\
\
When you're broken like a toy\
When your burdens get too heavy\
When you're weary to the bone\
I will help you hold it steady\
Pack it up and head for home\
\
I will love you come whatever\
I will be there when you call\
I'll encourage each endeavor\
Be the first one to applaud\
I'll correct you when you're sideways\
I will praise you when you win\
I will be there for you always\
With a love that never ends\
\
I will always (I will always)\
I will always (I will always)\
I will always (always) be lovin' you\
\
Midst the chaos and confusion\
I am never far behind\
My love is your transfusion\
To restore your soul and mind\
I will nurse you back to freedom\
Doctor up your shattered parts\
Two arms here when you need 'em\
And one lovin', open heart\
And if the world should end tomorrow\
And we both know that it might\
'Mongst the darkness and the sorrow\
I will be your guiding light\
And if God sees fit to let us\
Be together ever more\
If I had one question granted\
That's what I would ask him for\
\
And I will love you come whatever\
I will catch you when you fall\
I'll encourage each endeavor\
When your back's against the wall\
I will hold you when you're fragile\
I will always let you in\
I will rock you like a sweet child\
Like a lover and a friend\
\

I will rock you like a baby\
Be your lover and your friend\
I'll defend you, I will mend you\

'Rose garden'\
\
\
There's gotta be a little rain some time\
When you take you gotta give so live and let live\
Or let go oh-whoa-whoa-whoa\
I beg your pardon\
I never promised you a rose garden\
\
I could promise you things like big diamond rings\
But you don't find roses growin' on stalks of clover\
So you better think it over\
Well if sweet-talkin' you could make it come true\
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter\
But what would it matter\
So smile for a while and let's be jolly\
Love shouldn't be so melancholy\
Come along and share the good times while we can\
\
I beg your pardon\
I never promised you a rose garden\
Along with the sunshine\
There's gotta be a little rain some time\
\
[Brief Instrumental Interlude]\
I beg your pardon\
I never promised you a rose garden\
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon\
But if that's what it takes to hold you\
I'd just as soon let you go\
But there's one thing I want you to know\
You better look before you leap, still waters run deep\
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out\
And you know what I'm talkin' about\
So smile for a while and let's be jolly\
Love shouldn't be so melancholy\
Come along and share the good times while we can\
\
I beg your pardon\
I never promised you a rose garden\

'But You Know I Love You'\
\
\
All that's left behind is a chain of broken dreams\
But you know that I love you\
You know that I love you\
Oh, I love you\
\
And how I wish that love was all we'd need to live\
What a life we'd have 'cause I've got so much to give\
But you know I feel so sad down inside my heart\
That the dollar signs should be keeping us apart\
But you know that I love you\
You know that I love you\
Oh, how I love you\
\
And if only I could find my way back to the time\
When the problems of this life had not yet crossed my mind\
And the answers could be found in children's nursery rhymes\
I'd come running back to you, I'd come running back to you\
\
But you know we can't live on dreams alone\
Got to pay the rent, so I must leave you all alone\
'Cause you know I made my choice many years ago\
And now this traveling life, well, it's the only life I know\
But you know that I love you\
You know that I love you\
Oh, I love you\
But you know that I love you\
You know that I love you\
Oh, how I love you\
But you know that I love you\
You know that I love you\
Oh, how I love you\
\
But you know I love you\
But you know I love you\
Oh, I love you\
But you know that I love you\

When Bethlehem glowed in a circle\uc0\u8197 of love\

'It\'92s Too Late (To Love Me Now)'\

And it's too late\
Once my love for you was so great\
But it's too late to love me now\
\
[Verse 2]\
It's too bad\
You say you need me\
And it's too bad\
I know the feeling and it's so sad\
But it's too late to love me now\
It's too late to love me now\
\
[Chorus]\
Don't you know how hard I tried to hold out just for you?\
Loving you from memory, day by day\
Then someone came into my life, turned my dreams around\
He's taking all the love you threw away\
\
[Verse 3]\
It's too late\
You say you love me\
And it's too late\
Once my love for you was so great\
But it's too late to love me now\
It's too late to love me now\

'The Story'\
\
\
And how I got to where I am\
\
But these stories don't mean anything\
When you've got no one to tell them to\
It's true\
I was made for you\
\
I climbed across the mountaintops\
Swam all across the ocean blue\
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules\
But baby I broke them all for you\
\
Oh because even when I was flat broke\
You made me feel like a million bucks\
You do\
I was made for you\
\
You see the smile that's on my mouth\
It's hiding the words that don't come out\
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed\
They don't know my head is a mess\
\
No they don't know who I really am\
And they don't know what I've been through\
Like you do, and I was made for you\
All of these lines across my face\
Tell you the story of who I am\
So many stories of where I've been\
And how I got to where I am\
\
Oh but these stories don't mean anything\
When you've got no one to tell them to\
It's true\
I was made for you\

'J.J. Sneed'\
\
\
Turn your heart against me with her evil cunning eyes her evil cunning eyes\
JJ it's been you and me right from the very start\
And ever job we ever pulled I'd always done my part\
We agreed we'd stick together until the bitter end\
It was my understanding we were whole lots more than friends\
A whole lot more than friends\
And it was me that kept you on when nights were dark and cold\
But I guess I didn't look like much in these old ragged clothes\
But you said it didn't matter because you love me that a way\
You said that no one else could ever steal your heart away, steal your heart away\
Do you recall the Union Bank we robbed in Franklin Town\
And as we made our getaway the sheriff gunned you down\
And I doctored up your bullet wounds and nursed you while you sit\
But now you have betrayed me is that the thanks I get is that the thanks I get\
Oh yeah JJ I'm thinking now of how it all begun\
Of all the times we've robbed and killed with our trustworthy gun\
Why we stood off a possy once JJ just you and I\
But now you have betrayed me and for that you're going to die\
Yeah for that you're going to die\
The good old days are over as we stand here in the rain\
JJ I'm going to shoot you now I hope you feel no pain\

'Rockin\'92'\
\
\
Carl Perkins and those blue suede shoes had no place on the farm\
But they was better than them brogans I was wearin' around the barn!\
With my transistor radio my uncle bought for me\
I danced and pranced around the smoky hills of Tennessee\
Singing, "Don't Be Cruel", "Great Balls of Fire" and "Be good, Johnny B!"\
I was just a child, but I went hog wild for the rhythm and the beat!\
\
[Chorus]\
I've been rockin', rockin', rockin' since the day I was born\
I'll be rockin' 'til the day I'm gon\uc0\u1077 !\
I've still got rock and roll down in my country soul\
And I'll be rockin' it 'til the cows com\uc0\u1077  home\
\
[Verse 2]\
A dancin' foot, a prayin' knee don't fit on the same leg\
That's what that country preacher said when he would plead and beg\
"Give up that devil music! It'll send you straight to hell!"\
It sent me straight to heaven when I heard that guitar wail\
[Rock it, Dolly!] I'm rockin' it!\
\
[Chorus]\
I've been rockin', rockin', rockin' since the day I was born\
I'll be rockin' 'til the day I'm gone!\
Yeah, I've got rock and roll down in my country soul\
And I'll be rockin' it 'til the cows come home\
[Bridge]\
Here I am on the stage, you all know my name!\
With many country accolades, country's in my veins\
But since I heard the big news, I ain't never been the same\
'Cause they done gone and put me in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!\
\
[Chorus]\
I've been rockin', rockin', rockin' since the day I was born\
I'll be rockin' 'til the day I'm gone!\
I've still got rock and roll down in my country soul\
And I'll be rockin' it 'til the cows come home\
\
[Outro]\
Y'all put me in the Hall of Fame, so I guess there ain't no shame!\

'Time After Time'\
\
\
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind\
Suitcase of memories\
Time after\
\
[Verse 2]\
Sometimes you picture me, I'm walkin' too far ahead\
You're callin' to me, I can't hear what you've said\
Then you say, "Go slow", I fall behind\
The second hand unwinds\
\
[Chorus]\
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me\
Time after time\
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting\
Time after time\
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me\
Time after time\
If you fall, I will catch you, (I'll be waiting) I will be waiting\
Time after time\
\
[Verse 3]\
After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray\
Watchin' through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay\
Secrets stolen from deep inside\
The drum beats out of time\
[Chorus]\
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me\
Time after time\
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting\
Time after time\

You say, "Go slow," I fall behind\

You were so strange\

Used to let you wear all of my clothes\
You were so fine\
Hah, baby, that's the reason that it hurt me so\

When you were mine\

When he was there\
Sleeping in between the two of us\

'Money Changes Everything'\
\
\
"Aw, honey, how could you do it?\
We swore each other everlasting love"\
I said, "Well, yeah, I know, but when we did\
There was one thing we weren't thinking of, and that's money"\
\
[Chorus]\
Money changes everything\
I said money, money changes everything\
We think we know what we're doing, that don't mean a thing\
It's all in the past now, money changes everything\
\
[Verse 2]\
They shake your hand and they smile, and they buy you a drink\
They say, "We'll be your friends, we'll stick with you 'til the end"\
Ah, but everybody's only\
Looking out for themselves\
And you say, "Well, who can you trust?"\
I'll tell you, it's just nobody else, it's money\
\
[Chorus]\
Money changes everything\
I said money, money changes everything\
You think you know what you're doing, we don't pull the strings\
It's all in the past now, money changes everything\
[Instrumental Bridge]\
\
[Chorus]\
Yeah, yeah, yeah, money, money changes everything\
I said money, money changes everything\
We think we know what we're doing, we don't know a thing\
It's all in the past now, money changes everything\
\
[Outro]\
Hey, yeah, yeah\
Money is everything, yes\
Money changes everything, yeah\
Money is everything\
Money is everything, yes\

'Change of Heart'\
\
\
I'm your friend\
Just like you think it should be\
Did you think I would stand here and lie?\
While our moment was passing us by\
Oh, while I'm here\
\
[Chorus: Cyndi Lauper & The Bangles]\
Waiting for your change of heart\
It just takes a beat\
To turn it around\
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart\
At the edge of my seat\
Please turn it around\
\
[Verse 2: Cyndi Lauper]\
Days go by\
Leaving me with a hunger\
I could fly\
Back to when we were younger\
When adventures like cars we would ride\
And the years lied ahead still untried\
While I stand here\
[Chorus: Cyndi Lauper & The Bangles]\
Waiting for your change of heart\
It just takes a beat\
To turn it around\
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart\
At the edge of my seat\
Please turn it around\
Turn it around, around, around\
Turn it around, around, around\
Turn it around\
\
[Verse 3: Cyndi Lauper]\
Blind leading blind\
Never feel the laughter\
Search through time\
Nothing reveals the answer\
If its truth that you're looking to find\
And its nowhere outside of your mind\
When I bide my time\
\
[Chorus: Cyndi Lauper & The Bangles]\
Waiting for your change of heart\
It just takes a beat\
To turn it around\
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart\
At the edge of my seat\
Please turn it around\
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart\
It just takes a beat\
To turn it around\
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart\
At the edge of my seat\
Please turn it around\
Turn it around, around, around\
Turn it around, around, around\
Turn it around, around, around\

'I Want A Mom That Will Last Forever'\
\
\
I want a mom that will last forever\
I want a mom who will love me whatever\
\
[Verse 1]\
I want a mom that'll take my hand\
And make me feel like a holiday\
A mom to tuck me in that night\
And chase the monsters away\
I want a mom that'll read me stories\
And sing a lullaby\
And if I have a bad dream, to hold me when I cry\
\
[Chorus]\
I want a mom that will last forever\
I want a mom to make it all better\
I want a mom that will last forever\
I want a mom who will love me whatever, forever\

To watch and protect me I don't have to be scared\
Oh, and when she says to me, I will always love you\
I won't need to worry, cause I know that it's true\
[Verse 2]\
I want a mom when I get lonely\
Who will take the time to play\
A mom who can be a friend and a rainbow when it's gray\
I want a mom to read me stories\
And sing a lullaby\
And if I have a bad dream, to hold me when I cry\
Oh\

'I\'92ll Kiss You'\
\
\
"You know what I want from you\
So honey, won't ya gimme number 9?"\
\
[Refrain 1]\
'Cause you know lately, I ain't feeling so great\
Last time, she gave me love potion number 8\
And you know, pretty baby, how I think you're pretty smart\
But one sip from this bottle, and I'll tear you all apart\
\
[Verse 2]\
The gypsy told me that the first thing that would happen\
You get dizzy\
Second thing\
You better make sure that your boyfriend isn't busy\
'Cause you won't wanna eat, and you won't wanna drink\
You won't wanna talk, and you won't wanna think\
My mother used to tell me not to kiss on this first date\
This time when I see you, you know I ain't gonna wait\
\
[Chorus]\
I'll kiss you\
Gonna corner you, and not let you go\
I'll kiss you\
Don't tell me nothing, I don't wanna know\
Twiddly dee, and twiddly dum\
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you\
[Verse 3]\
Hopped into a taxi\
Told the driver got to get me 'cross town\
Killed the bottle, started seeing double\
When the driver turned around\
\
[Refrain 2]\
And though I was a failure with love potion number 8\
Number 9 was different, and the hour's getting late\
Now, I'm standing on the corner\
Everyone looks great to me\
And if you come and get me, take me where I want to be\
\
[Chorus]\
I'll kiss you\
Gonna corner you, and not let you go\
I'll kiss you\
Don't tell me nothing, I don't wanna know\
Twiddly dee, and twiddly dum\
I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you\
\
[Refrain 1]\
'Cause you know lately, I ain't feeling so great\
And last time, she gave me love potion number 8\

I'll kiss you\
Gonna corner you, and not let you go\

I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you, I'll kiss you\

Oh, you know lately, I ain't feeling so great (I'll kiss you)\

'Sally\'92s Pigeons'\
\
\
Make believe and play pretend\
We were innocent and wild\
Hopped a fence and slammed the gate\
Running down my alleyway\
In time to watch Sally's pigeons fly\
\
[Verse 2]\
We loved to watch them dive and soar\
Circle in the sky\
Free as a bird from three to four\
And never knowing why\
Neighbors pulled their wash back in\
Put away my Barbie and Ken\
Look out overhead\
While Sally's pigeons fly\
\
[Bridge]\
I had a fool's confidence\
That the world had no boundaries\
But instincts and common sense\
Come in different quantities\
\
[Verse 3]\
My heart began to\
Skip to the beat\
Of the boy next door\
She had her eye across the street\
On someone shy and tall\
We lived our dreams\
And challenged fate\
In tears, she told me she was late\
And Sally let his pigeons out to fly\
[Verse 4]\
On the dresser sits a frame\
With a photograph\
Two little girls in ponytails\
Some twenty-one years back\
She left one night with just a nod\
Was lost from some back alley job\
I close my eyes and Sally's pigeons fly\
She never saw those birds again\
And me, I can't remember when\
A pirate smile hasn't made me cry\
\
\
\
'Boy Blue'\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
You never knew yourself well enough, ah\
But she never knew you at all\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And when she put you out on your own\
It may have stolen your innocence\
But not, no-not your soul\
\
[Chorus]\
Tell me, where is little boy blue?\
You'll find him standing always one step ahead, oh\
Fast a little, shy a little, boy blue, woah!\
Wise blood runs warms and deep\
On the street, kids walking\
Just a kid walking, just a kid\
\
[Verse 2]\
You send a letter with photographs, ah\
I'll tuck them under my dreams\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And if we wake up old beyond our years\
Not quite as brave as we seem\
It's just the pain that never disappears\
[Chorus]\
Tell me, where is little boy blue?\
You'll find him standing always one step ahead, oh\
Fast a little, shy a little, boy blue, woah!\
Wise blood runs warms and deep\
On the street, kids walking\
Just a kid walking, just a kid\
\
[Bridge]\
Ooh\
Where are you?\
Where are you?\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
And when she put you out on your own\
It may have stolen your innocence\
But not, no-not your soul\
\
[Chorus]\
Tell me, where is little boy blue?\
You'll find him standing always one step ahead, oh\
Dance a little, cry a little, boy blue, woah-woah!\
Wise blood runs warms and deep\
On the street, kids walking\
Just a kid walking, just a kid walking\
Just a kid\
[Outro]\
Where are you?\
Where are you? Where are you, boy blue? Oh\
Where are you?\
You're always walking one step ahead\
You're always walking one step ahead\
Ooh\

Underneath it all\
I think I'm afraid when there's nothing wrong\
\
[Chorus]\
But if I was fearless\
Could I be your reckless friend\
And if I was helpless\
Would you be the one comes rushing in\
\
[Verse 2]\
There's something that I never told\
When I find myself slipping off\
Of my pedestal\
I'm a fierce believer afraid to fall\
\
[Chorus]\
But if I was fearless\
Could I be your reckless friend\
And if I was helpless\
Would you be the one comes rushing in\
\
[Verse 3]\
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark\
I can't find the light in my heart\
I can see my hand\
Pushing away from you hard as I can\
[Chorus]\
But if I was fearless\
Could I be your reckless friend\
And if I was helpless\
Would you be the one comes rushing in\

Don't wanna hear that you'll stay in touch maybe\

I'll get by just fine\
So if you're goin' then darlin' goodbye, goodbye\

And I don't think I care\
And I don't want to be your friend\
\
I'll forget we ever met\
I'll forget I ever let\
Ever let you into this heart of mine baby\
You just gotta let me be\
You gotta keep away from me\
'Cause all I want to be is just free of you baby\
Don't you come around\
And say you still care about me\
Go now, go now\
Don't call me in the middle of the night no more\
Don't expect me to be there\
Don't think that it will be the way it was before\
I'm not over you yet\
And I don't think I care\
And I don't want to be your friend\
\
You take it casually, and that's what's killing me\
\
I'll get by just fine\
So if you're goin' then darlin' goodbye, goodbye now\

'That\'92s What I Think'\
\
\
Sometimes I think\
I don't know what I'll do\
But I forget the world\
And everything around me\
That's what I think\
When I think about you\
\
[Verse 1]\
The streets are filled\
With too many babies\
Black air in the sky of of blue\
People pass by\
No life in their eyes\
The concrete jungle's\
Really going crazy\
\
[Chorus]\
Sometimes I think\
Things are overwhelming\
Sometimes I think\
I don't know what I'll do\
But I forget the world\
And everything around me\
That's what I think\
When I think about you\
[Verse 2]\
The rent is due\
And the pockets are empty\
People ask machines for the truth\
No crystal ball to help see it all\
But where we gonna find\
The dreams to feed the babies\
\
[Bridge]\
Baby life goes on\
That's what people say\
But I'm nowhere if you go away\
I'd just be looking for a brighter day\
\

Sometimes I think\
Things are overwhelming\
Sometimes I think\
I don't know what I'll do\

'I\'92m Gonna Be Strong'\
\
\
That I'll plead with you to stay\
But I'm gonna be strong\
And let you go your way\
\
Love is gone\
There's no sense in holding on\
And your pity now\
Would be more than I could bare\
But I'm gonna be strong\
And pretend I don't care\
\
I'm gonna be strong\
And stand as tall as I can\
I'm gonna be strong\
And let you go along\
And take it like a man\
\
When you say it's the end\
I'll hand you a line\
I'll smile and say\
Don't you worry I'm fine\
But you'll never know darling\

'Hat Full of Stars'\
\
\
So I tore around the room like a bird without a head\
I saw your picture waving back at me from underneath the bed\
From a long, long time ago\
\
[Chorus 1]\
When all I had was a hat full of stars\
The one I'll always treasure\
The one that you wore\
You loved the look but you never looked inside\
You would have seen us there\
You could've seen far\
You should've seen the magic\
In my hat full of stars\
\
[Verse 2]\
I'm trying to live in the present, but I keep tripping on the past\
Finding out reality - well, clarity, comes in drips and drabs\
No, we never had the time for everything we had\
So it felt like we had nothing, that's what makes this hat so sad\
It was a long, long time ago\
\
[Chorus 2]\
When all we had was a hat full of stars\
The one I'll always treasure\
The one that you wore\
You loved the look, but you never looked inside\
You would have seen us there\
You could've seen far\
You should've seen the magic\
In my hat full of stars\
[Bridge]\
Now whenever I'm alone and I think I might forget\
I wear my lucky hat just like a crown up on my head\
\
[Chorus 3 + Outro]\
'Cause all I had was a hat full of stars\
The one I'll always treasure\
The one that you wore\
You loved the look, but you didn't look inside\
If you could see me now\
You would've seen far\
You should've seen the magic\
In my hat full of stars\
In my hat full of stars\
\

'The World Is Stone'\
\
\
\
Stone the world is stone\
Cold to the touch\
And hard on the soul\
In the grey of the streets\
In the neon unknown\
I look for a sign\
That im not on my own\
That im not here alone\
\
As the still of the night\
And the choke of the air\
And the winners delight\
And the losers despair\
Closes in left and right\
I would love not ot care\
\
Stone, the world is stone\
From the far away look\
Without stars in my eyes\
Throught the halls of the rich\
And the flats of the poor\
Wherever I go\
Theres no warmth anymore\
Theres no love anymore\
So I turn on my heels\
Im declining the fall\
Ive had all I can take\
With my back to the wall\
Tell the world im not in\
Im not taking the call\
\
Stone the world is stone\
But I saw it once\
With the stars in my eyes\
When each colour rang out\
In a thunderous chrome\
Its no trick of the light\
\
\
\
'Unconditional Love'\
\
\
But I'm not sure I know how\
I lose faith and I lose ground\
Then I see you and remember\
\
[Refrain]\
Unconditional love\
Love, love\
Unconditional love\
\
[Verse 2]\
It doesn't matter what I say\
'Cause it always seems you're taking me the wrong way\
But if you could read my mind, you'd see\
I fight myself all the time\
When I see you I surrender\
\
[Refrain]\
Unconditional love\
Love, love (Unconditional)\
Unconditional\
\
[Bridge]\
Standing on a wilder shore\
I got my head up in the clouds, oh\
I ain't got no sense of direction now\
[Verse 3]\
I wanna lie next to you\
And I wanna do everything you want me to\
Sometimes I wish at the sky\
I imagine what the clouds look like\
When I see you I remember\
\
[Refrain]\
Unconditional love\
Love, love\
Unconditional love\
When I see you I surrender\
\
[Outro]\
Unconditional love\
(Love, love)\
(By myself, oh) Yeah, ooh-ooh, oh (Unconditional love)\
Love (Love, love) Oh-oh, oh\

When I see you I surrender\
Unconditional love\
(Love, love) Yeah, oh yeah\
(Unconditional love) Yeah-yeah, ye-ye-ye-ye-yeah\
(Love, love) Love, oh-love\
(Unconditional) oh-love, oh, love\

'Dancing With a Stranger'\
\
\
Move to the right, and\
The whole place starts to shake\
\
Without a net on a real high wire\
I'm stepping out with my heels on fire\
\
I started dancing with a stranger\
Moving to the break of day\
Dancing with a stranger\
And I just got swept away\
\
Letting go my inhibitions\
Is harder to do than say\
But I surrender to the beat\
I start shuffling my feet\
When I hear that music play\
\
I trip the light fantastic\
I touch the sky and it feels like magic\
\
I started dancing with a stranger\
Moving to the break of day\
Dancing with a stranger\
And I just got swept away\
Give me a dance, dance\
Dancing with a stranger\
And it takes my breath away\
\
I ain't looking for mister right\
It doesn't matter to me\
There's something in the air\
Electric I like\
Igniting endlessly\
\
I started to dance...\
\
Without a net on a real high wire\
I'm stepping out with my heels on fire\
\
I started dancing with a stranger\
Moving to the break of day\
\
\
\
'I Don\'92t Want To Cry'\
\
\
Yes, I know\
But I don't wanna cry anymore\
My heart, and I\
Have been a fool, I know\
If you don't love me\
Let me go\
'Cause I don't wanna cry anymore\
Oh darling, how I tried\
Just to keep you satisfied\
But all of my love was in vain\
If you had only cared\
All about this love affair\
You wouldn't let my tears\
Fall like drops of rain\
My heart and I\
Have been a fool, I know\
I guess it's time to close the door\
'Cause I don't wanna cry anymore\
I don't wanna cry anymore...\
Don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry anymore\
I-I don't, don't wanna cry anymore\
Don't wanna cry\
Don't wanna cry anymore\
Don't wanna cry anymore\
Don't wanna cry\

'Hymn to Love'\
\
\
All the times that we have known\
I will sing a hymn to love\
\
[Verse 2]\
We had lived and dreamed we two alone\
In a world that seemed our very own\
With its memory ever grateful\
Just for you I sing a hymn to love\
\
[Bridge]\
I remember each embrace\
The smile that lights your face\
And my heart begins to sing\
Your arms, your hands secure\
Your eyes that said be sure\
And my heart begins to sing\
\
[Verse 3]\
If one day we had to say goodbye\
And our love would fade away and die\
In my heart you will remain\
And I will sing a hymn to love\
[Verse 4]\
Those who love will live eternally\
In the blue where all is harmony\
With my voice raised up to heaven\
Just for you, I'll sing a hymn to love\

'Calm Inside the Storm'\
\
\
I can live my life playing hide and seek\
But when I look inside, it's hard to make believe\
Ah-ha\
Ooh-ha\
\
[Verse 2]\
'n lately\
You seem so far away\
I wish I could say something, but I don't know what to say\
I can feel your eyes, I don't have to look at you\
Boy, discontentment is a sneakin'-through\
Ah-ha\
\
[Chorus]\
You never really want anything\
But what you really need is everything\
I'll give you something only life can bring\
The calm inside the storm\
Love me a little, love me long\
Ooh-woah, woah-yeah\

Love me a little, love me long\
Ah-ah\
[Verse 3]\
Don't you know you should be holding me?\
But you're all locked inside\
Why don't you throw me your keys?\
I'm like a rockin' ship on your rollin' sea\
You know crash and lightnin' never frightens me, nah-nah\

'Who Let in the Rain'\
\
\
I always thought\
We'd be together down the line\
We start to fight\
And can't get over what was said\
'Cause you see black and white\
And I see red\
\
[Chorus]\
And I wonder who let in the rain\
You know without you\
I'm not the same\
When love gets strong\
People get weak\
Sometimes they lose control\
And wind up in too deep\
They fall like rain\
Who let in the rain?\
\
[Verse 2]\
I make the bed and cover\
Where you used to sleep\
I'm smoothing over promises\
Made in these sheets\
I envy lovers passing by\
Out on the street\
'Cause what they have\
I couldn't keep\
[Chorus]\
And I wonder who let in the rain\
You know without you\
I'm not the same\
When love gets strong\
People get weak\
Sometimes they lose control\
And wind up in too deep\
They fall like rain\
Who let in the rain?\
Who let in the rain?\
\
[Instrumental Break]\
\
[Chorus]\
And I wonder who let in the rain\
You know without you\
I'm not the same\
When love gets strong\
People get weak\
Sometimes they lose control\
And wind up in too deep\
They fall like rain (Fall like rain)\
Who let in the rain?\
\
[Outro]\
Who let in the rain?\
Who let in this rain?\
Who let in the rain, ah-ha\
(Who let in the, who let in the, who let in the)\
Who let in the rain?\
Who let in this rain?\
(Who let in, who let in, who let in the rain?)\
Who let in the rain, who let in the rain?\
Who let in the rain?\
Who let in the, who let in the, who let in the, who let in the\

'Heading West'\
\
\
In a jigsaw dream with soft spoken words\
I woke up crying and no one heard\
\
[Pre-Chorus 1]\
You're looking through me like I never was real\
You say you love me but you won't let me feel\
So I'm gonna take a chance this time\
Find myself some place where I can heal\
\
[Chorus]\
And I'm heading west\
Without a sad goodbye\
And I'm heading west, woah-oh-oh\
I'm like a letter with no address\
Just like a book I read\
I'm heading west\
\
[Verse 2]\
I said my name under my breath\
Oh, he turned down a twisted road, I won't forget\
I'm gonna fly my kite and let out all of the string\
Hold on to hope, let go everything\
[Pre-Chorus 2]\
I can't stop laughing and it's nothing you said\
The altitude of freedom seems to go to my head\
And if I fall down on my knees, I'm gonna get back up\
I'm gonna get back up again\
\
[Chorus]\
And I'm heading west\
Without a sad goodbye\
And I'm heading west, woah-oh-oh\
I'm like a letter with no address\
Just like a book I read\
I'm heading west\
\
[Bridge]\
And if I fall down on my knees\
I'm gonna get back up\
I'm gonna get back up\
\
[Chorus]\
And I'm heading west\
Without a sad goodbye\
And I'm heading west, woah-oh-oh\
I'm like a letter with no address\
Just like a book I read\
I'm heading west\
And I'm heading west\
Without, oh, a sad goodbye\
And I'm heading west, woah-oh-oh\
I'm like a letter with no address\
Just like a book I read\
I'm heading west\
And I'm heading west\
Without a sad goodbye\

Oh reconsider, I'm begging you, some hesitation\
I'm holding on to my sanity\
I feel the beginning of emergency\
My hands are slipping, Oh please don't let me fall into\

This hole in my heart that goes all the way to China\
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of..\
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to China\
And though you can't see the bottom, believe me it's a long way down\
\
I'm on a planet without a plan\
It's oh so lonely\
I need to see you to get out of here\
There's something deadly in this atmosphere\
I'm in a desert, without a drink of your sweet water\
You're my oasis in the burning sand\
I'm out of danger when you touch my hand\
\
Throw me a lifeline, I'm standing oh the edge of ..\
A deep, dark hole that goes all the way to China\
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of ...\
This empty hole in my heart that goes all the way to China\
And though you can't see the bottom believe me it's a long way down\
A hole in my heart\
Somebody cover it up\
I've got this hole in my heart\
You've got to fill it up with love\
\
Now the gun was loaded, I didn't know\
I pulled the trigger\
I heard a noise - the room went dark\
I felt the bullet going in my heart\
\
I feel so dizzy, oh please don't let me fall, don't leave me in\
\
This hole in my heart that goes all the way to China\
You gotta fill it up with love before I fall inside of...\

Oh, you came back, but never meant to stay\

Troubles by the score\

Is the day my world will end\

And said that you was a-coming home to stay\
With hoping heart, I waited for your knock at the door\
I waited but you must've lost your way\

Troubles by the score\

But the day that I stop counting\
Is the day my world will end\

'Feels Like Christmas'\

I can be your sweetie\
If you be a friend of mine\
And I won't be forsaken\
If you think thoughts unkind\
Just bring home the bacon\
And bring it home on time\

[Verse 1]\
Hey Louie, can't you see?\
I couldn't leave you if I tried\
Hey Louie, listen to me\
We got a thing so dignified\
It don't matter if we lived in a shack\
Or in a shiny Cadillac\
It don't matter rich or poor\
When love is knocking at your door\

It feels like Christmas\
Just like Christmas\
It feels like Christmas with you\
It feels like Christmas\
Just like Christmas\

I can't be bitter when you're here with me\
Hey Louie, no regrets\
Holding on to things that you oughta forget\
Well, it doesn't matter tit for tat\
'Cause what you give, you get it back\
It don't matter anymore\
When love is knocking at your door\

'Unhook the Stars'\
\
\
Just when life should be resolving, I'm back at the beginning\
And it comes back to the heart\
\
[Pre-Chorus 1]\
I'm not really sad, I'm not running, I'm looking\
Did I tell you I kept all your letters and cards?\
\
[Chorus 1]\
There's just nothing left for me to do here but unhook the stars\
There's just nothing left for me to do here but unhook the stars\
\
[Verse 2]\
Do you remember when I told you all that I could\
And it seemed like too much\
I was living your life, hoping you'd never fall\
If I held on tight enough\
\
[Pre-Chorus 2]\
And letting go now is like a passport to anywhere\
With time on my hands I can make a new start\
\
[Chorus 2]\
I just didn't wanna stay here and unhook the stars\
I just didn't wanna stay here and unhook the stars\

Waiting in the wings\
Made me drunk with possibilities\
Rivals my memories\

I didn't wanna stay here and unhook the stars\
I just didn't wanna stay here and unhook the stars\
\
[Verse 1]\

Just when life should be resolving and I'm back at the beginning\
It comes back to the heart\

Did I tell you I kept all your letters and cards?\

'At Last'\

My lonely days over\
And life is like a song\
Ooh, at last\
The skies above are blue\
My heart was wrapped up in clover\
The night I looked at you\

That I could speak to\
A dream that I could call my own\
I found a thrill\
To press my cheek to\
A thrill that I have never known\

But I didn't mean it\
If I said something wrong\

Big whisper, small scream\
But it's not like what it seems\
Locked up in the open\
Don't know which way to go\
Ooh, deserts, oceans\
Leaving footprints in the sand\
Hoping that you'll see them\
And wishing you'd follow\
\
[Bridge]\
Walk with me hand in hand, ya-ha\
And talk with me, you got a plan? Ah-ha\
And hold me, and hold me\
Don't stop\
\
[Refrain]\
Out in the faraway nearby\
Can your hear me call?\
Out in the faraway nearby\

'Tears Dry on Their Own'\
\
\
All I can ever be to you is the darkness that we knew\
And this regret I've got accustomed to\
Once it was so right, when we were at our height\
Waiting for you in the hotel at night\
I knew I hadn't met my match\
But every moment we could snatch\
I don't know why I got so attached\
It's my responsibility\
And you don't owe nothing to me\
But to walk away, I have no capacity\
\
[Chorus]\
He walks away, the sun goes down\
He takes the day, but I'm grown (I'm grown)\
And in your way, in this blue shade\
My tears dry on their own\
\
[Verse 2]\
I don't understand, why do I stress the man?\
When there's so many bigger things at hand\
We could've never had it all\
We had to hit a wall\
So this is inevitable withdrawal\
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through\
I'll be some next man's other woman soon\
I cannot play myself again\
I should just be my own best friend\
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men\

What kind of fuckery is this?\
You made me miss the Slick Rick gig (Oh, Slick Rick)\
And thought I didn't love you when I did (When I did)\
Can't believe you played me out like that\
\
[Verse 1]\
No, you ain't worth guest list\
Plus one of all them girls you kiss (All them girls)\
You can't keep lying to yourself like this (To yourself)\
Can't believe you played yourself (Out) like this\

Nowadays you don't mean dick to me (Dick to me)\

'Love Is a Losing Game'\
\
\
Five-story fire as you came\
Love is a losing game\
One I wished I never played\
Oh, what a mess we made\
And now the final frame\
Love is a losing game\
\
[Verse 2]\
Played out by the band\
Love is a losing hand\
More than I could stand\
Love is a losing hand\
Self-professed, profound\
'Til the chips were down\
Know you're a gambling man\
Love is a losing hand\
\
[Verse 3]\
Though I battle blind\
Love is a fate resigned\
Memories mar my mind\
Love is a fate resigned\
Over futile odds\
And laughed at by the gods\

'Intro / Stronger Than Me'\
\
\
\
Part II: "Stronger Than Me"\
\
[Verse 1]\
You should be stronger than me\
You been here seven years longer than me\
Don't you know you supposed to be the man?\
Not pale in comparison to who you think I am\
You always wanna talk it through, I don't care\
I always have to comfort you when I'm there\
But that's what I need you to do, stroke my hair\
\
[Chorus]\
'Cause I've forgotten all of young love's joy\
Feel like a lady and you my ladyboy\
\
[Verse 2]\
You should be stronger than me\
But instead you're longer than frozen turkey\
Why'd you always put me in control?\
All I need is for my man to live up to his role\
Always wanna talk it through, I'm okay\
Always have to comfort you every day\
But that's what I need you to do, are you gay?\

Thought you had so many lessons to learn"\
I said, "You don't know what love is, get a grip\
Sound as if you're reading from some other tired script"\
I'm not gonna meet your mother anytime\
I just wanna grip your body over mine\
Please tell me why you think that's a crime\

I've forgotten all of young love's joy\
Feel like a lady and you my ladyboy\

'Wake Up Alone'\
\
\
Got so sick of crying, so just lately\
When I catch myself, I do a 180\
I stay up, clean the house, at least I'm not drinking\
Run around just so I don't have to think about thinking\
That silent sense of content that everyone gets\
Just disappears soon as the sun sets\
\
[Chorus]\
He's fierce in my dreams, seizing my guts\
He floods me with dread\
Soaked in sorrow, he swims in my eyes by the bed\
Pour myself over him\
Moon spilling in\
And I wake up alone\
\
[Verse 2]\
As far as my heart, I'd rather be restless\
Second I stop, the sleep catches up and I'm breathless\
'Cause this ache in my chest, 'cause my day is done now\
The dark covers me and I cannot run now\
My blood running cold, I stand before him (Before him)\
It's all I can do to assure him (Assure him)\
When he comes to me, I drip for him tonight\
Drowning me, we bathe under blue light (Under blue)\

'Fuck Me Pumps'\
\
\
[Verse 1]\
When you walk in the bar\
And you're dressed like a star\
Rockin' your "eff me" pumps\
And a man notice you with your Gucci bag crew\
Can't tell who he's looking to\
'Cause you all look the same, everyone knows your name\
And that's your whole claim to fame\
Never miss a night, 'cause your dream in life\
Is to be a footballer\'92s wife\
\
[Chorus]\
You don't like players\
That's what you say\
But you really wouldn't mind a millionaire\
You don't like ballers\
They don't do nothing for ya\
But you'd love a rich man six-foot-two or taller\
\
[Verse 2]\
You're more than a fan lookin' for a man\
But you end up with one-night stands\
He could be your whole life if you got past one night\
But that part never goes right\
In the morning, you're vexed\
He's on to the next\
And you didn't even get no text\
Don't be too upset if they call you a sket\
'Cause like the news, every day, you get pressed\

\
[Verse 3]\
You can't sit down right, 'cause your jeans are too tight\
And you lucky it's ladies' night\
With your big empty purse\
Every week it gets worse\
At least your breast cost more than hers\
So you did Miami, 'cause you got there for free\
But, somehow, you missed the plane\
You did too much E\
Met somebody and spent the night getting caned\
\
[Bridge]\
Without girls like you, there'd be no fun\
We'd go to the club and not see anyone\
Without girls like you, there's no night life\
All those men just go home to their wives\
Don't be mad at me 'cause you're pushing thirty\
And your old tricks no longer work\
You should have known from the jump\
\
\
\
'Just Friends'\
\
\
'Cause I've been drinking\
Not in the morning where your shit works\
It's always dangerous when everybody's sleeping\
And I've been thinking\
"Can we be alone?\
Can we be alone?"\
\
[Chorus]\
When will we get the time to be just friends?\
When will we get the time to be just friends?\
\
[Verse 2]\
And, no, I'm not ashamed but the guilt will kill you\
If she don't first\
I'll never love you like her\
Though we need to find the time to just do this shit together\
For it gets worse\
I wanna touch you, but that just hurts\

\
\
Oh\
\
[Verse 1]\
He can only hold her for so long\
The lights are on, but no one's home\
She's so vacant, her soul is taken\
He thinks, "What's she running from?"\
\
[Chorus]\
Now how can he have her heart\
When it got stole?\
So he tries to pacify her\
Because what's inside her never dies\
\
[Verse 2]\
Even if she's content in his warmth\
She is plagued with urgency\
Searching kisses, the man she misses\
The man that he longs to be\

'You Sent Me Flying'\
\
\
Tough to sort files with your voice in my head\
So then I bribed you downstairs with a Marlboro Red, uh\
And now I feel so small discovering you knew\
How much more torture would you have put me through?\
You probably saw me laughing at all your jokes\
Or how I did not mind when you stole all my smokes, yeah\
\
[Chorus]\
And although my pride is not easy to disturb, yeah\
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb\
With your battered jeans and your Beasties tee\
Now I can't work like this, no, no, with you next to me\
\
[Verse 2]\
And although he's nothing in the scheme of my years\
It just serves to bludgeon my futile tears\
And I'm not use to this, no, no\
I observe, yeah, I don't chase\
But now I sit with consequences thrust in my face, yeah\
And the melodramas of my day deliver blows\
And that surpass your rejection, it just goes to show\
A simple attraction that reflects right back to me\
So I'm not as into you as I appear to be\

[Verse 3]\
His message was brutal, but the delivery was kind\
Maybe if I get this down, I'll get it off my mind, yeah\
Oh, it serves to condition me and smoothen my kinks, yeah\
Despite my frustration for the way that he thinks\
And I knew the truth, when it came, would be to that effect\
At least you're attracted to me which I did not expect\
Didn't think you'd get my number down as such\
But I've never hated myself for my age so much, yeah\
\
[Chorus]\
And although my pride, yeah, is not easy to disturb, yeah\
You sent me flying when you kicked me to the curb\

'In My Bed'\
\
\
Wish I could say it breaks my heart\
Like you did in the beginning\
It's not that we grew apart\
A nightingale no longer singin'\
It's something I know you can't do\
Separate sex with emotion\
I sleep alone, the sun comes up\
You're still clinging to that notion\
\
[Pre-Chorus]\
Everything is slowin' down\
River of no return\
Recognise my every sound\
There's nothin' new to learn\
\
[Chorus]\
You'll never get my mind right\
Like two ships passing in the night\
In the night, in the night\
Want the same thing when we lay\
Otherwise, mine's a different way\
A different way from where I'm going\
Oh, it's you again\
Listen, this isn't a reunion\
So sorry if I turn my head\
Yours is a familiar face\
But that don't make your place safe\
In my bed, my bed, my bed\

I don't care about what you got, I want it all\

And I question myself again, "What is it 'bout men?"\
My destructive side has grown a mile wide\
And I question myself again, "What is it 'bout men?\
What is it 'bout men?"\

And I'll take the wrong man as naturally as I sing\

You are everything\
He means nothing to me\
I can't even remember his name\
Why're you so upset?\
Baby, you weren't there\
And I was thinking of you when I came\

[Verse 3]\
What do you expect?\
You left me here alone\
I drank so much and needed your touch\
Don't overreact, I pretended he was you\
You wouldn't want me to be lonely\
How can I put it so you understand?\
I didn't let him hold my hand\
But he looked like you\
I guess he looked like you\
No, he wasn't you\
But you can still trust me, this ain't infidelity\

Now I really empathise\
Looking through your bloodshot eyes\
And I know you, you're so frustrated\
But we all become what we once hated\
Besides, nobody can be that wise\
\
[Chorus]\
I can't help you if you won't help yourself (Help yourself, help yourself)\
I can't help you if you don't help yourself (Help yourself, no, no, no)\
You can only get so much from someone else (You can only get so much from me)\
I can't help you if you won't help yourself (You won't help yourself)\

[Verse 2]\
You got a degree in philosophy (Philosophy)\
So you  think you clever-er than me ('Cause you so smart)\
But I'm not just some drama queen (Drama queen)\
'Cause it's where you're at, not where you've been\
So, what do you expect from me? (What do you want?)\
To hold your head above the sea? (Keep you high and dry)\
And carry you, even though you bigger\
'Cause don't you know you crush my tiny figure?\
And, anyway, we still so young (Yeah, I'm so young)\
And this isn't yesterday\

Such a funny thing, but every time you're near me\
I never can behave\
You give me the smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic\
There's music all around me\
Crazy music, music that keeps calling me so\
Very close to you, turns me your slave\
Come on and do with me any little thing you want to\
Anything, baby, just let me get next to you\
So am I insane or do I really see Heaven in your eyes?\
Bright as stars that shine up above you\
In the clear blue skies, how I worry about you\
Just can't live my life without you\
Baby, come here, don't have no fear\
Oh, is there a wonder why\
I'm really feeling in the mood for love\
So tell me why, stop to think about this weather, my dear\
This little dream might fade away\
There I go talking out of my head again, baby, won't you\
Come and put our two hearts together?\
That would make me strong and brave\
Oh, when we are one, I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid\
Now if there's a cloud up above us\
Come on and let it rain\
I'm sure our love together will endure a hurricane\
Oh, my baby, won't you please let me love you\
And give relief from this awful misery\
What is all this talk about loving me, my sweet?\
I am not afraid, not anymore, not like before\

'Tears Dry (Original Version)'\
\
\
Once it felt so right, anticipation at its height\
Lived and waited in hotel rooms late at night\
I knew I hadn't met my match\
With every moment we could snatch\
I don't know why I let myself get so attached\
It's my responsibility\
And you don't owe nothing to me\
But to cut myself off, I had no capacity\
\
[Chorus]\
He walks away, the sun goes down\
He takes the day, but I am grown\
And in your grey, in this cool shade\
My tears dry on their own (Tears dry on their own)\
\
[Verse 2]\
I don't understand, why do I stress the man?\
When there's so many bigger things than him at hand\
We could've never had it all\
We had to hit a wall\
And this is inevitable withdrawal\
Even if I stop wanting you and perspective pushes through\
I'll be some next man's other woman soon\
I cannot play myself again\
I should just be my own best friend\
Not fuck myself in the head with stupid men\

He takes the day, but I am grown\

But my hair, just does it's own thing and I gotta look alright\
And I gotta write a chorus but words allude me now\
I have to get this down before I leave somehow\
\
And anyway I be thinkin' to meet you at the station\
Guilty 'cause I should be home, damn procrastination\
So when they ask me later, I won't tell them how it's going\
But now my head is empty and the work load keeps on growing\
\
[Chorus]\
Try to put me in a room, distraction less\
(Anything and everything)\
Spare me from work\
In the studio I will find a book\
(All the time is all you got)\
Tempts me to look\
Try to put me in a room, distraction less\
(Anything and everything)\
Spare me from work\
In the studio I will find a book\

'My Own Way (Demo)'\
\
\
Seems to me the price is high\
So I'll keep my own company\
And I'll do what I want, when I feel\
\
[Verse 2]\
Watch them fall so easily\
Temporary insanity\
Some say that true love is blind\
Me, I like to clarify\
While I, I just take my own time and I\
\
[Chorus]\
I'll go my own way\
I walk when I wanna\
Talk, talk, when I wanna\
Finding my own way\
I walk when I wanna\
Talk, talk, when I wanna\
\
[Verse 3]\
Seems to be illogical\
Love that's unconditional, yeah\
Give your all to someone else\
But save a little for yourself\
That's why I'm, I'm taking my own time, and I'm\

I'll go my own way\
I walk when I wanna\
Talk, talk when I wanna, yeah\
Finding my own way\
I walk when I wanna\
Talk, talk when I wanna\
\
[Bridge]\
Don't get me wrong, it's kinda cynical\
But it scares me though\
So I'm careful with my heart\
It's the only one I got\
I cannot commit to that shit\
\
[Chorus]\
I'll go my own way (Oh, yeah)\
I'll talk when I wanna\
Finding my own way\
I walk when I wanna\
Talk, I talk when I wanna\
I'll go my own way (I'll go my own way)\
And I'll walk when I wanna and tell you when I wanna\

'When My Eyes'\
\
\
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\
\
[Verse 1]\
Waitress on skates in training\
They dart to call it dreamin'\
Images present themselves to me\
Seeds are ripe for reapin'\
I continue sleepin'\
You're everything you ever wanted to be, yeah\
And nothin' here is changin'\
No messy rearrangin'\
'Cause every set of ficus stays the same\
Sinatra's always singin'\
And you do all the clingin'\
And someone else accepts my place\
\
[Chorus]\
Whatever my imagination throws\
So rugged, growin' rose\
When my eyes do close\
When my eyes do close\
When they close\
You might also like[Verse 2]\
Turn and face my ceilin'\
Deep in all the feelin'\
Inhibitions turn to dust and fly away\
Stop my eyelids flickerin'\
With your petty bickerin'\
But this time, I say what I got to say\
I hear my girl Dinah's playin'\
And a tree's branches start swayin'\
Run over and sit right by the roof\
And I see the leaves are growin'\
Little birds are showin'\
Reach out a hand and bite into the fruit\
\
[Chorus]\
Whatever my imagination throws\
So rugged, growin' rose\
When my eyes do close\
When my eyes do close\
When they close\
\
[Bridge]\
Nothin' such a scrutiny (Nothin' such a scrutiny)\
Avoidin' all the mutiny\
You are lovin', beautifully\
And it's fragrant beautifully\
Colourful and monochrome\
Amy Winehouse alone\
Far away from ringin' phone at home\
I turn to stone, turn to stone\
And all the thoughts are static\
Yeah, my singin' is automatic\
And I wish that I could sell it\
And my every urge, you tell her\
'Cause I can sense no danger\
I am the lone ranger through the desert in a yellow caddy\
With a black-haired, blue-eyed stranger\
[Verse 3]\
White dress outside dryin'\
I've been a fear for flyin'\
I overtake Montgomery in skills, yeah\
Never been more darin'\
Kitten heels I'm wearin'\
Reality, a blow that sometimes kills\
And when I drop it lyrically\
Worlds evolve generically\
And I don't ever need to collapse in tears\
And I could curse your timin'\
Thunderously mimin'\
And I feel young beyond my years\
\
[Chorus]\
Whatever my imagination throws\
So rugged, growin' rose\
When my eyes do close\
