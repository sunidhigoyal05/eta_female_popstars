'uc0u8203 don'92t wanna break up again'


I fall asleep cryin'
You turn up the TV
You don't wanna hear me
One more sleepless night
Big day in the morning
So, I take my time to self-soothe

I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't

I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again), baby

I made it so easy
Spent so much on therapy
Blamed my own codependency
But you didn't even try
When you finally did, it was at the wrong time
Won't abandon me again for you and I, I
I'm too much for you
So I really gotta do
The thing I don't wanna do
No, I don't, don't, don't, don't

I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart (Breakin' my heart)
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again)

We both know it's time
So we say goodbye
Just one kiss goodbye
With tears in our eyes
Hope you won't, won't regret me
Hope you'll still think fondly of our little life

I don't wanna fuck with your head
It's breakin' my heart (Breakin' my heart)
To keep breakin' yours again (Yours again, yours again, yours again)
This situationship has to end
But I just can't refuse
I don't wanna break up again (Up again, up again, up again), baby
[Outro]
(Hah, hah, hah)
(Hah, hah, hah)
Don't wanna break up again (Breakin' my heart)
I don't wanna, baby
Situationship has to end (Know it has to end)

I wish I could believe you, then I'll be alright
But now everything you told me really don't apply
To the way I feel inside
Lovin' you was easy once upon a time
But now, my suspicions of you have multiplied
And it's all because you lied

I only give you a hard time
'Cause I can't go on and pretend like
I haven't tried to forget this
But I'm much too full of resentment

Just can't seem to get over (Ooh)
The way you hurt me (Ooh)
Don't know how you gave another
Who didn't mean a thing, no (Mean a thing)
The very thing you gave to me (Ooh)

Like I couldn't do it for you (You lied)
Like your mistress could (Ooh)
And it's all because you lied
Loved you more than ever (You lied)
More than my own life (You lied)

I know she was attractive, but I was here first
Been ridin' with you for six years
Why did I deserve to be treated this way by you?
I know you're probably thinkin', ""What's up with B?""
I been cryin' for too long, what did you do to me?
I used to be so strong, but now you took my soul
I'm cryin', can't stop cryin', can't stop cryin'
You could've told me you wasn't happy
I know you didn't wanna hurt me
But look what you've done to me now
I gotta look at her in her eyes (You lied, you lied)

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you

Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, five-star
Backseat lovin' in the car

I really tried to stay cool

Now I ripped your dress and you're all black and blue
Look what you made me do

They keep sayin' that I ain't nothin' like my father
But I'm the furthest thing from choir boys and altars
If you cross me, I'm just like my father
I am colder than Titanic water

They ain't ever been safe ones
I don't fellowship with these fakuc0u1077  ones
So let's travel to whituc0u1077  chapels and sing hymns
Hold rosaries, and sing in stained glass symphonies
Cleanse me, Holy Trinity
From this marijuana smoke smell in my hair

I sashayed my dress
Did my best impression of a damsel in distress
This alcohol and smell of regret
Allured my catch
Outfit too small to hide my scars
Feelin' bottled up like bottle service broads
How long can he hold his breath before his death?

Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes, I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe that with me you're a changed man
Foolish of me to compete when you cheat with loose women

And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on I'm gon' be my own best friend
You're so controlling, you say that you love me, but you don't
Your family told me one day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing with your three kids in my home
Love is so blind, it feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over, stop callin' me, come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front like you're still with me, all your homies know

On a long back road, all the tears I fight
Sixteen carriages driving away
While I watch them ride with my fears away
To the summer sunset on a holy night
On a long back road, all these tears I fight

Oh, oh
Oh

At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray
Had to take care of home at an early age
I saw Mama cryin', I saw Daddy lyin'
Had to sacrifice and leave my fears behind
For legacy, if it's the last thing I do
You'll remember me 'cause we got somethin' to prove
In your memory, on the highway to truth
Still see our faces when you close your eyes

BEYONCE,"Tried to be soft, prettier
Less... awake
Fasted for 60 days
Wore white
Abstained from mirrors
Abstained from sex
Slowly did not speak another word
And that time my hair I grew past my ankles
I slept on a mat on the floor
I swallowed a sword
I levitated
Into the basement
Confessed my sins
And was baptized in a river
Got on my knees and said, ""Amen""
And said, ""I mean""
I whipped my own back
And asked for dominion at your feet
I threw myself into a volcano
I drank the blood and drank the wine
I sat alone and begged and bent at the waist for God
I crossed myself in thought
I saw the devil
I grew thickened skin on my feet
I bathed in bleach
And plugged my menses with the pages from the holy book
But still inside me coiled deep was the need to know

'That'92s What I Think'


Sometimes I think
I don't know what I'll do
But I forget the world
And everything around me
That's what I think
When I think about you

The streets are filled
With too many babies
Black air in the sky of of blue
People pass by
No life in their eyes
The concrete jungle's
Really going crazy

Sometimes I think
Things are overwhelming
Sometimes I think
I don't know what I'll do
But I forget the world
And everything around me
That's what I think
When I think about you
The rent is due
And the pockets are empty
People ask machines for the truth
No crystal ball to help see it all
But where we gonna find
The dreams to feed the babies

Baby life goes on
That's what people say
But I'm nowhere if you go away
I'd just be looking for a brighter day

Sometimes I think
Things are overwhelming
Sometimes I think
I don't know what I'll do
But I forget the world
And everything around me

That I'll plead with you to stay
But I'm gonna be strong
And let you go your way

Love is gone
There's no sense in holding on
And your pity now
Would be more than I could bare
But I'm gonna be strong
And pretend I don't care

I'm gonna be strong
And stand as tall as I can
I'm gonna be strong
And let you go along
And take it like a man

When you say it's the end
I'll hand you a line
I'll smile and say
Don't you worry I'm fine
But you'll never know darling

'Sally'92s Pigeons'


Make believe and play pretend
We were innocent and wild
Hopped a fence and slammed the gate
Running down my alleyway
In time to watch Sally's pigeons fly

We loved to watch them dive and soar
Circle in the sky
Free as a bird from three to four
And never knowing why
Neighbors pulled their wash back in
Put away my Barbie and Ken
Look out overhead
While Sally's pigeons fly

I had a fool's confidence
That the world had no boundaries
But instincts and common sense
Come in different quantities

My heart began to
Skip to the beat
Of the boy next door
She had her eye across the street
On someone shy and tall
We lived our dreams
And challenged fate
In tears, she told me she was late
And Sally let his pigeons out to fly
On the dresser sits a frame
With a photograph
Two little girls in ponytails
Some twenty-one years back
She left one night with just a nod
Was lost from some back alley job
I close my eyes and Sally's pigeons fly
She never saw those birds again
And me, I can't remember when
A pirate smile hasn't made me cry
",boy blue,2
CYNDI LAUPER,"I'm your friend
Just like you think it should be
Did you think I would stand here and lie?
While our moment was passing us by
Oh, while I'm here

Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around

Days go by
Leaving me with a hunger
I could fly
Back to when we were younger
When adventures like cars we would ride
And the years lied ahead still untried
While I stand here
Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around

Blind leading blind
Never feel the laughter
Search through time
Nothing reveals the answer
If its truth that you're looking to find
And its nowhere outside of your mind
When I bide my time

Waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
It just takes a beat
To turn it around
Yes, I'm waiting for your change of heart
At the edge of my seat
Please turn it around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around, around, around
Turn it around, around, around

I saw your picture waving back at me from underneath the bed

You loved the look but you never looked inside
You would have seen us there
You could've seen far

In my hat full of stars

I'm trying to live in the present, but I keep tripping on the past
Finding out reality - well, clarity, comes in drips and drabs

So it felt like we had nothing, that's what makes this hat so sad

He said, I love you so much, but you must understand

Silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world, they won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold

And he said to me, let's rest for awhile
For I have some good news to share with you, child
He said, you can't change this old world
The people need to know that a dear savior died here
A long, long time ago

And silver and gold might buy you a home
But things of this world, they won't last you long
And time has a way of turning us old
And time can't be bought back with silver and gold

His hair was long and flowing and his back was slightly bent
And I knew he knew it, 'cause that day I changed
As I watched him walk on, I forgot to get his name
He said silver and gold can't buy you a home
When this life has ended and your time has gone
But you can live in a world where you never grow old

'Lonely Comin'92 Down'


Then I looked for you, but you could not be found
And then I felt the lonely coming down

I walked across the room to the empty bed
Saw the imprint on the pillow where you laid your head
The presence of you still lingered all around
And once again I felt the lonely coming down

Then I felt the lonely dripping down my face
As I realized no one could take your place
I wondered where the love had gone that we had found
And then again I felt the lonely coming down

The sun behind a cloud just casts the crawling shadow
Over the fields of clover
And time is running out for me I wish
That he would hurry down from Dover

He's been gone so long
When he left the snow was deep upon the ground
And I have seen a spring and summer pass
And now the leaves are turning brown
And any time a tiny face will show itself
Because waiting's almost over
But I won't have a name to give
It if he doesn't hurry down from Dover
From Dover, from Dover

My folks weren't understanding when they found out
They sent me from the home place
My daddy said if folks found out
He'd be ashamed to ever show his face
My mamma said I was a fool
And she did not believe it when I told her
That everything would be all right
Because soon he would be coming down from Dover
I found a place to stay out
On a farm takin' care of that old lady
She never asked me nuthin'
So I never talked to her about my baby
I sent a message to my mom
With a name and address of Ms. ol' Grover
And to make sure he got that information
When he came down from Dover

I loved him more than anything
And I could not refuse him when he needed me
He was the only one I'd loved
And I just can't believe that he was using me
He couldn't leave me here like this
I know it can't be so, it can't be over
He wouldn't make me go through this alone
Oh he'll be coming down from Dover

She'd never have a father's arms to hold her

And how my mama put the rags to use

There were rags of many colors, every piece was small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the fall
Mama sewed the rags together sewing every piece with love
She made my coat of many colors that I was so proud of

As she sewed, she told a story from the Bible she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she said
Perhaps this coat will bring you good luck and happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear it and momma blessed it with a kiss

My coat of many colors that my mama made for me
Made only from rags but I wore it so proudly
Although we had no money I was rich as I could be
In my coat of many colors my mama made for me

So with patches on my britches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to school
Just to find the others laughing and making fun of me
But they didn't understand it for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my mama sewed in every stitch
And I told them all the story mama told me while she sewed
And how my coat of many colors was worth more than all their clothes

But they didn't understand it and I tried to make them see
That one is only poor only if they choose to be

'Just Because I'92m a Woman'


And I'm sorry that I'm not
The woman you thought I'd be

Yes, I've made my mistakes
But listen and understand
My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

So when you look at me
Don't feel sorry for yourself
Just think of all the shame
You might have brought somebody else
Just let me tell you this
Then we'll both know where we stand

My mistakes are no worse than yours
Just because I'm a woman

Now a man will take a good girl
And he'll ruin her reputation
But when he wants to marry
Well, that's a different situation
He'll just walk off and leave her
To do the best she can
While he looks for an angel
To wear his wedding band

Now I know that I'm no angel
If that's what you thought you'd found
I was just the victim of
A man that lets me down

From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all

I'm just a Backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair
Don't be fooled by thinking that the goods are not all there

I'm as shallow as I look cause I run true and deep

I've always been misunderstood because of how I look
Don't judge me by the cover cause I'm a real good book
So read into it what you will, but see me as I am
The way I look is just a country girl's idea of glam

I'm just a Backwoods Barbie in a push-up bra and heels
I might look artificial, but where it counts I'm real
And I'm all dolled up and hoping for a chance to prove my worth
And even Backwoods Barbie's get their feelings hurt

'Old Flames (Can'92t Hold a Candle to You)'


I caught a spark from his eyes of forgotten desire
With a word, or a touch, I could have rekindled that fire

Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do
Flickering embers of love, I've known one or two
Old flames can't hold a candle to you

Sometimes at night I think of old lovers I've known
I remember how holding them helped me not feel so alone
Then I feel you beside me and even their memories are gone
Like stars in the night lost in the sweet light of dawn

Old flames can't hold a candle to you
No one can light up the night like you do

'Rockin'92'


Carl Perkins and those blue suede shoes had no place on the farm
But they was better than them brogans I was wearin' around the barn!
With my transistor radio my uncle bought for me
I danced and pranced around the smoky hills of Tennessee
Singing, ""Don't Be Cruel"", ""Great Balls of Fire"" and ""Be good, Johnny B!""
I was just a child, but I went hog wild for the rhythm and the beat!

I've been rockin', rockin', rockin' since the day I was born
I'll be rockin' 'til the day I'm gonuc0u1077 !
I've still got rock and roll down in my country soul
And I'll be rockin' it 'til the cows comuc0u1077  home

A dancin' foot, a prayin' knee don't fit on the same leg
That's what that country preacher said when he would plead and beg
""Give up that devil music! It'll send you straight to hell!""
It sent me straight to heaven when I heard that guitar wail
[Rock it, Dolly!] I'm rockin' it!

I've been rockin', rockin', rockin' since the day I was born
I'll be rockin' 'til the day I'm gone!
Yeah, I've got rock and roll down in my country soul
And I'll be rockin' it 'til the cows come home
Here I am on the stage, you all know my name!
With many country accolades, country's in my veins
But since I heard the big news, I ain't never been the same
'Cause they done gone and put me in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame!

I've been rockin', rockin', rockin' since the day I was born
I'll be rockin' 'til the day I'm gone!
I've still got rock and roll down in my country soul
And I'll be rockin' it 'til the cows come home

And in it lived a man I'd never seen

So I took me out walkin' down the railroad track

There was a big black dog layin' out in the yard
And it growled at me and I swallowed hard
And I heard somebody say, ""Well, who are you?""
Oh, and there he stood in the door of that shack
And his beard and his hair was long and black
And he was the biggest man I'd ever seen

Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?

You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in

Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go
But I wish I was there with you
Oh, I wish I was there with you

A bird in my room
Angels all over that watch over you
When I'm walking on water

Still, nothing means nothing
Without you, you

'Thinking '92Bout You'


This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane

I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

And at that point I had to do some dying and really accept the fact that, look, ""this is who I am, and I have to be who I am, and all of us have a right to be who we are, and whenever we submit our will, because our will is a gift, it is given to us, so whenever we submit our will to someone else's opinion, you know, I mean, a part of us dies.""

You know, and so it's been, um... it's been... it actually hasn't been a long time. It feels like a long time, but it hasn't been a long time. Some miraculous things have happened in a short amount of time, and uh, I'm just very blessed to be able to be here today and get to share with you some of the things I've learned.

I know some of it sounds almost cryptic and I been really just, just really... waiting for the patience and really just articulate where I'm coming from as simply as possible, so I'm working on that.

But um... you know, I know, that you know that there's, uh... you know that I know that God doesn't lie and I know that he knows how to talk to the hearts of people better than anybody else, so I don't worry about that, cause whatever he relates to whomever is listening, that's what supposed to be understood at that time, so it's all good.

LAURYN HILL,"
Ironically, these oppressors would try to discard this same God, who supposedly justified this brutality, in the name of Darwin, whose famous line '91survival of the fittest'92 was used to justify criminal behavior once the Bible could no longer be used as a hiding place for economic domination and evil intention.
Spirituality and morality were replaced by capitalism, and with it a conscious shift of focus toward the exploitation of the vulnerable.

Of course there are white people who live transcendent lives, not exploiting ill-gotten privilege or perpetuating the sins of their ancestors who used violence and deceit as a means to gain advantage over others. Humanity in proper order is obligated to acknowledge the Truth, whoever it comes from, be they Black, White or other. Righteous indignation is simply a response to long-standing evil.

Much of the world is still reeling from the abuses of Imperialist selfishness, misunderstanding, ignorance and greed. Black people remain in many ways a shattered community, disenfranchised, forcefully removed from context and still caged in, denied from making truly independent choices and experiencing existential freedom. Their natural homes, just like their natural selves, raped and pillaged of the resources and gifts God has given to them. Interpreted through someone else'92s slanted lens and filter, they remain in many ways, misrepresented. Taxation without proper representation, might I remind you, was the very platform of protest that began the Revolutionary War, which gained this country its independence from England. Anger is not only the natural response to the abuse of power, but is also appropriate when there is no real acknowledgment of these abuses, or deep, meaningful and profound change.

If we took all of what we deem horrible regarding the criminal abuses that black people have committed over this country'92s history, and add it all up, it still does not compare to the hundreds of years of terrorism, violent domination, theft, rape, abuse, captivity, and beyond that black people have suffered under the ideologies and systems of white supremacy, racism, and slave based paradigms. I say this only to say that abuse unresolved begets or creates abuse. How then does the chief offender become the judge? Might does not necessarily mean right. Right is right. People forcibly reduced to sub-human existences, so that they behave in sub-human ways, helps a system to justify itself or feel less guilty about its blood saturated foundation and gross crimes against humanity. People, like plants, grow where the light is. When you enclose a plant and limit its light source, it will bend itself toward the light, for the light is necessary for its survival. This same thing happens to people locked in communities where little light and little opportunity is allowed them, survival then forces them to twist and/or bend toward the only way of escape.

There is good. And I both acknowledge and encourage the good. Instead of throwing out the Baby with the bath water, we do well to expose the intentionally poisoned water the Baby has been forced to soak in since its origin in these lands. America'92s particular brand of hypocrisy is gross (double entendre).

I shuddered during sentencing when I kept hearing the term '91make the IRS whole'92'85 make the IRS whole, knowing that I got into these very circumstances having to deal with the very energies of inequity and resistance that created and perpetuated these savage inequalities. The entire time, I thought, who has made black people whole?! Who has made recompense for stealing, imposing, lying, murdering, criminalizing the traumatized, taking them against their wills, destroying their homes, dividing their communities, '91trying'92 to steal their destinies, their time, stagnating their development, I could go on and on. Has America, or any of the nations of the world guilty of these atrocities, ever made black people or Africa whole or do they continue to sit on them, control them, manipulate them, cage them, rob them, brutalize them, subject them to rules that don'92t apply to all? Use language, veiled coercion, and psychological torment like invisible fences to keep them locked into a pattern of limitation and therefore control by others. You have to remain focused to cease from rage.

The prosecutor, who was a woman, made a statement during sentencing about me not doing any charity work for a number of years during my '91exile.'92 A) Charity work is not a requirement, but something done because someone wants to. I was clearly doing charitable works way before other people were even thinking about it. And B) Even the judge had to comment that she, meaning I, was both having and raising children during this period. As if that was not challenging enough to do. She sounded like the echo of the grotesque slave master, who expected women to give birth while in the field, scoop the Baby up, and then continue to work. Disgusting.

When you are beaten and penalized for being independent, or truly self reliant, then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with self-reliance, and a fear of true independence. When you are beaten or threatened with death for trying to read a book, then you develop a dysfunctional relationship with education. When families are broken up by force and threat of violence, then the family structure becomes dysfunctional. When men who would naturally defend their women and families are threatened with castration and death, then this natural response also becomes dysfunctional. When looking at the oppressor is punishable by violence, then examination of him and his system becomes a difficult and taboo thing to do, despite every bone in your body demanding it. When questioning or opposing oppression is punishable by death, imprisonment, or economic assassination, then opposing systemic wrong in any or all of its meta manifestations is a terrifying concept. Anyone forced to live so incredibly diametrically opposed to that which is natural to themselves, will end up in crisis if they don'92t successfully find a way to improve or transcend these circumstances! All of which require healing. It is only by the Grace of God and the resilience of the people that things haven'92t been worse.

Much of my music, if not all of it, is about Love, a therapeutic resolve created in response to the lack of messages encouraging people like me toward free moral agency. Helping to ameliorate this condition has never been addressed through the political arena alone. It is a sacrificial work that doesn'92t simply happen between the hours of 9 to 5 or Monday through Friday, but when inspiration leads us to avail ourselves for the Truth that needs to be said. Unlike the system too often contrarily demonstrates, we believe that people can be and should be helped, and that trauma should not be criminalized but acknowledged, healed and dealt with. This takes awareness, sensitivity and a level of freedom in my opinion the system lacks. And if we don'92t know or understand how to do it, then we humbly refer to a higher authority.
We have no desire to create humanoids, turn people into machines, or dumb them down so that they remain dependent longer than necessary to an antiquated system in denial of its many inadequacies and need to evolve. Instead we seek to educate and shed light on the snares, traps, and enticements that people set up in the name of business that are intended only to catch the sleeping and/or uninformed.

This is a strange song because this song -- when this song was written, this is when everything sort of stopped. It was written a long time ago, but it was right before God just snatched me out of everything. And because I didn't understand... Initially it was written -- I'd written it about the whole Amadou Diallo situation, when it first happened. And I went to the studio, and I laid it down. And it was like, strong, for the first day. And then it just regressed everyday after that. And I said, ""What's going on? What's happening?""

And at the end of it there was a word that i used, ""rebel."" And I guess was afraid. It was such a hot time in the city at that point, I was afraid that if I
Put the record out, people would misunderstand what I meant by ""rebel"" and they'd just take it to the streets. So I was very intimidated and afraid. And before I knew it a whole host of things happened. Everything stopped after that. And the creativity stopped. Everything stopped. That's when I realized I had to understand what I was talking about before I could tell somebody else what I was talking about. And I had to be, you know, a living example

It's real crazy because I don't know what the press is saying because I don't listen to the press too much. But I know the view is that I'm emotionally unstable, which is reality. Like you aren't?

I'm laughing because what I've realized I've become is one of those mad scientists who does the tests on themselves first, you see, to make sure that they work. And that's when you know, OK look, I got something that works. You know what I'm saying? I'm not gonna give you something that I haven't tested for myself. And you go through, and you're learning by way of experience, and you're making mistakes, and you're getting up

LAURYN HILL,"A yes is fine (laughing) okay?
(voice from audience '93I love that song'94)
Thank you. Praise God.

I tell you, I know everybody'92s in the same mess. I'92m telling you.
We all are.
I, I, I know that, you know...
and I'92m just, you know, I'92ll be the first to tell you, you know,
I'92m a mess and God is dealing with me everyday. And everyday I'92m trying, you know, how I can be less of a mess. Cuz you know, he showed me, Look Lauryn, you know, You'92re the problem, okay, I'92m going to show you how you'92re causing the problem, and now I want you to be the solution. And that'92s what all of these songs are about, just, problem, cause and solution. Free your mind.

It'92s like, we all think that the gospel is join and church building, and that'92s deception, you know.
The real gospel is Repent, which means '91let go of all that crap,'92 that'92s killin'92 you.
Life was supposed to be a pleasurable experience, not this torment, you know.
And when I realized that I was tormenting myself, it was about my lust.
It wasn'92t about things that I needed it was just, you know, all these security blankets. I mean, the more I acquired I became more of a prisoner. I mean, you know, forty people on staff, and you can'92t do nothing, and now creativity is impossible because all you can think about is all these folks that you know, you'92re supporting and carryin'92 and you know, it'92s not good. You know, everybody'85
a friend of mine says that every tub has to stand on it'92s own bottom, you know. And in that respect, we all get to do what our passion is.
See , that'92s what praisin God is all about, is doing your passion.

You know, it'92s not useless, worthless ritual, you know, monotonous ritual, where we just show up and can'92t wait to see the game, you know. It'92s doing your passion and fulfilling your passion. You know.
That'92s how we'92re thankful. That'92s how we say we appreciate the opportunity to be alive.

And I'92m just glad that I, you know, I don'92t have to slave anymore. You know, cuz I, music was my love, and because of everything I thought had to accompany my music it became my burden. It just got stolen from me. I said, What is this? How did this thing that I love so much so easily and so quickly turn to something I loath and hate?
And so now, you know, I understand that it was because I was measuring myself or trying to compare myself to a standard that wasn'92t reality. It wasn'92t the standard at all, you know. T
here'92s a scripture in the Bible that we, what does it say, it says '91We compare ourselves amongst ourselves'92 you know. That'92s not the standard. You already are the standard. What are you trying to fit into a standard for? We were each created to be individual standards, you know. And we'92re trying to fit into a standard? It doesn'92t make any sense, you know.
So now I'92m just, you know, after all that, I'92m just ready to be me. And it'92s a lot to work through, you know, because all of us have hidden in these little boxes purposely, because of parts of ourselves that we were unhappy about. And it'92s because we didn'92t understand, you know, because there'92s all this social doctrine that says, you know, that
The infinite God, with all this expression,
who created every single one of us,
absolutely different,
On purpose,
wants everybody to fit into the same suit.
But like, you know, that'92s deception.
That'92s deception.

(Talking to someone offstage) Okay, let me just, I think this is the wrong one (laughing) I don'92t think this is the right one.

We took'85we were in, um, Florida this weekend and we took the kids to Disney world, and um, you know we were going, they gave us a tour. They escorted us through the back. And when they escorted us through the back, we got to see how, you know, there all these people workin all hard, and it was like, real dirty back there, and of course, in the front it was all immaculately clean.
And I said, I said, you know, People need to see the reality, they need to see, you know, how these people slave to maintain this illusion.
And it felt like my life. I said, If people only knew what it was.

It'92s like, you know, a bunch of musicians, listen, bustin'92 their '91mm'92 workin all hard to make it look easy. What'92s the point? You know, Oh, uh, I just threw this together, uh'85(audience laughs).
You know, it'92s like, you know what I'92m sayin?
I mean, you know.
Slaving.
Slaving to act like, you know, I wake up like this. And none of us do, you know, none of us do.
None of us do.
And reality is good cuz that means everybody could just exhale, let your belly out, you know, and chill. You know. But people get mad at me when I say, Look, let'92s stop frontin'92. And I'92m saying, you know, that'92s the blessing.
Now we can go around and look at each other and say, Oh, you got one too?!

And be free.
And we want to defend the curse. I'92ll tell ya, that was not fun. Did it for a long time...

Too long.
(offstage) You didn'92t find it? It'92s another white one. But you see'85in my purse. Or the, the other bag? Or the green one? Ghetto. You know, it'92s reality, okay (laughing)?

One time, it came to me, you know, I was just told very concretely.
You know, it was like that voice, the right one, said to me,
he said, Lauryn, You know the real you is more interesting than the fake somebody else.
I just want you to know that.

Because we always thought we could get, you know, we could get reality by just putting on the clothes and wearin'92 the face and you know, lookin hard in the video. But, you know. Reality is..it'92s like I'92ve always told to my husband, it'92s like, look, you know, we look at Bob Marley, you know, and we say Okay, let'92s just grow locks and wear the clothes and have the band and we have no many idea how many years of struggle and pain and suffering that made that content. You see what I'92m saying?

You can'92t get it from the outside in. Truth is from the inside out.

You know, and the way we'92ve been trying to heal and be healed is with these topical, surface, superficial, temporary solution. And I'92m telling you, true healing is from the inside out. You know, we'92ve been told to protect our outer man while our inner man is dying. (offstage) Oh, this is the one.

Boy I'92ll tell ya, God made him for me. I'92m something to put up with. And to endure that is amazing. I'92ll be the first to tell you, trust me. Y'92all could clap cuz that'92s some real work (more clapping). I was in there in the room, you know, before we came out here, and he said to me, I said, Ro should I change? And he said, Yeah. So I looked at him, I said, Why did you tell me to change I was comfortable, man. But I asked him the question. So I went in the room and I tried on all these clothes and I was like, I feel like an idiot. So I pulled out all these clothes and I'92m sayin, ok Ro, you know, Pack the bag neatly, you know, Could you put the clothes back in? And he'92s like, Alright. So he'92s trying to do this but then I'92m like, No! Now take this out! Now put that back and take that out! Put that back, hold that, take, that, put, The orange shoe! The orange shoe! So I'92m like. And then after awhile I just said, Ro baby, could you leave? Please get out the room. And I just put back on the clothes I came in. Okay, I was like'85I'92m just not there anymore. Nah, I'92m telling you. It'92s like, uh (laughing). Hey you know he'92s learned. Because before we used to just beef and now he'92s like, Okay'85I'92m out. It'92s real. God gave us a brand new relationship, man, I mean, one in truth, you know.

It'92s like, we date people, like let'92s say, you know, we'92re interested in somebody and we put on the perfume and dress up and then we do things that we will never ever ever do again! You understand what I'92m sayin? It'92s like'85And that'92s why so many marriages end up in divorce. It'92s because people wake up next to a stranger.
They say, Who the hell are you? What are you doing in this bed?
Where'92s that man that used to do '91du, dua, and du.'92
And I'92m sayin let'92s give them reality from the door because: you'92re going to attract love,
and the one that really loves you. And then you don'92t have to pretend and falsify, and you know, keep that posture.

You know, you know, I can'92t, I'92m just like...I'92ll never forget when I first met him I said to him, it was like, he saw me eating in front of him, and he told me, he was like, You eat like a man, you must not like me. You know, because, women, usually they keep that posture. And I said, Nah. I said it'92s not even that, you know. It'92s but, this is reality. This is, you know, and that'92s it, man, I mean, I'92m just telling you, it'92s so wonderful to finally find'85
And trust me, it'92s a work in progress, it'92s not something that happens overnight.
We all have to be introduced to each other.

I'92m telling you, I know that I'92m up here and you see, Lauryn Hill, you came to see Lauryn Hill.
But this is the first time y'92all meet me. You see what I'92m saying? Don'92t think you met me before, okay. And as I grow, you'92re going to meet me a little bit more. You'92re gonna be exposed to the real me a little bit more. I can tell you I had to reintroduce myself to everybody I know. My mother my father. Listen, y'92all never knew me. I want to introduce you to me. I'92m just getting to know me. And you know what, anything that'92s not growin' is dead, so we better be changing.

You know, people would say to me, they would hold me hostage. And they, seriously, emotionally hostage, and they'92d say, Uh, she'92s changing. The money'92s changing her. And I'92d say Listen, the money'92s not changing me, God'92s changing me. I'92m changing, because that'92s a natural part of life. We'92re all supposed to change. Who wakes up and is the same way tomorrow and the day after that? Nobody is. Let the experience teach you and be real, man.

And, um..there'92s gonna be warfare involved. Because there'92s some people who prefer deceptions, see. They say, uh, I don'92t like this new expression, and I say, what, you want two-thirds of me to stay outside? I'92m a whole person. You can'92t say, you know, two-thirds of Lauryn, come in here. Only two-thirds is acceptable. I'92m a whole person. You know. And that'92s everybody.

You always talk about spiritual warfare and we didn'92t realize that it was in relationships. It'92s emotional warfare. Being able to tell the people we love the most the truth about ourselves. And when they say, Hey that doesn'92t fit into our box for you, we say, well, I ain'92t in no box. Don'92t try to put me in one.

LAURYN HILL,"Afraid to address the reality before me
To proud to confess that I'm addicted to a lie
So I seek temporary feeling
To replace reality
Though the truth is telling me I have died

But I've been taught to numb it
Sedated, don't confront it
I hate it when I find out
That I can't get what I wanted
This emotional tantrum
Has become sort of an anthem playing every time I need to take a little trip

To hide this condemnation
I'll find a combination
Of man-made stimulation
To deny my situation
Now this unreality
Is distorting what I see
Reporting back to me
A sense of false security

So in my imagination
I must find a recreation
Desperately in search of ways
To alter my sensation
There's no equilibrium
Inebriated till I'm numb
Intoxicated until I'm dumb
To avoid confrontation

Messing with my mind
These social drugs
Telling me I'm fine

Now this chemical analogy
Is our emotional reality
These political, traditional
And ethnical stimulants
And social etiquette
Won't let us be too upset
With the way things really are
You're told to camouflage regret
In a religious structure
Tells us God wants us to suffer
To support a situation we all know is obligation

And if you shun the complication
They'll just gun your reputation
Like mob intimidation
To enforce participation

See they need to keep us fiends
To their lies and broken schemes
And if you find another means
You're told you're being too extreme
And if you wanted to get clean
They'll just pull those social strings
Holding up their social nose
Defying noble things
Now we're all stuck in tradition
Unable to state opposition
Too afraid to contradict
The expectations of the system
Oh and the harsh reality
Is they made grace for you and me
Instead of saving you and me
They're just enslaving you and me

LAURYN HILL,"And all I ever wanted was love
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me
Tried to make me feel like I was unworthy
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty
Truth was they never did deserve me
No!

I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is'85

Couldn't tell me I was loved when I needed it
When, all I ever wanted was love
Shoulda told me just because
I'm worth receiving it
But all I ever wanted was love
There's something awesome about the selflessness it
Takes to
Give love and the good that it makes you
True love can never really forsake you
But it took a little while just for me to see
I had to lose myself so I could love you better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is'85

I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure
And I couldn't love you perfectly with fear in my head
So I perilously had to face the danger
So I could come back and love you whole instead
All of your soul I said
So I could love you better

I had to lose myself so I could love you better

I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Love you better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could love you better
Had to lose myself in love
And that's just the way it is'85
B-Sec:
And so it goes that I never meant to hurt you
Couldn't stay but I never meant to desert you
Whole lot a things I just had to work through
Time to heal and restore my self-worth too
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety
Cried a whole lot years, I suffered quietly
And though it may have taken years I can finally
Tell you that you were always on my mind

I had to lose myself so I could make it better
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could
Make it better
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself
So I could make it better
Had to lose myself in love
And that was just the way!

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give
And I'd do it all again because for you I live

Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did
Great love to absorb all the abuse I did
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give
And I'd do it all again because for you I live

I'm about to change the focus from the richest to the brokest
Whoever's closest to the line's gonna win it
You gonna fall trying to ball while my team win the pennant
I'm about to begin it, for a minute, then run for senate
Make a slum lord be repentant, give his money to kids to spend it
And then amend it, every law that ever prevented
Our survival since our arrival documented in The Bible
Like Moses and Aaron, things gon' change, it's apparent
And all the transparent gonna be seen through
Let God redeem you, keep your deen true, you can get the green too
Watch out what you cling to, observe how a queen do
And I remain calm reading the 73rd Psalm
'Cause with all that'92s going on I got the world in my palm

You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour

Now I be breaking bread sipping Manischewitz wine
Pay no mind, party like it's 1999
But when it comes down to ground beef like Palestine
Say your rhymes, let's see if that get you out your bind
Now I'ma get the mozzarella like a Rockafeller
Still be in the church of Lalibela, singing hymns a cappella
Whether posed in Mirabella in Couture
Or collecting residuals from off The Score
I'm making sure I'm with the 144
I've been here before this ain't a battle, this is war
Word to Boonie, I make salat like a Sunni
Get diplomatic immunity in every ghetto community
Had opportunity went from Hoodshock to Hood-chic
But it ain't what you cop, it's about what you keep
And even if there are leaks, you can't capsize this ship
'Cause I baptize my lips every time I take a sip
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power
But keep your eyes on the Final Hour
You can get the money, you can get the power

Making pilgrimages, thinking he's religious
Like he's got all the light, and no one else
He takes the unsuspected
'Cause he knows they're not connected

Wanting to be intellectual
Drifting from the way, she got turned down one day
And now she thinks that she's bisexual

To the very antidote to their dilemma

Destroying the original agenda
Praying to the sky in order to maintain a lie
They exhausted every possible conclusion

Hiding from the truth

To explain away his desperate situation
When confronted, blamed his wife
Giving birth to carnal life
Refusing to acknowledge what he done

Who says we're guilty everyone before his eyes
Making no exceptions, since the day of our conception
Predisposed to hating truth, and loving lies

Time to get free, or give yourselves up now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time

Yo, there's a war in the mind, over territory
For the dominion
Who will dominate the opinion
Skisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion
Conformin' our vision
To the world church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election
Moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Destortin' our tape recorders
From hearin' like under water
Beyond the borders
Find the sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
A systematic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate, worse than Sodom
What's got 'em, drunk off the spirits
Truth comes, we can't hear it
When you've been, programmed to fear it
I had a vision I was fallin' in indescision
Apallin', callin' religious
Some program on television
How can, dominant wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of Anti-Christ, the majority rules
Intelligent fools
PhDs in illusion
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors in past delusion
Now who you choosin'?
The head, or the tail
The bloodshed of the male
Or confidence in the tale
Conferences is Yale
Discussin' doctrines of Baal
Causin' people to fail
Keepin' the third in jail
His word has nailed
Everything to the tree
Severing all of me
From all that I used to be
Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoy darkness as Lord
Keepin' me from the sword
Block for mercy
Bitter than cerasee
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
And still, dined at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong, in true enemies defeat
Destitute in a necessity
Causin' desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
Realizin' the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart
From words to fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity, shapen in
There's no escapin' when
Your whole philosophy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of a man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow, makin' love with a whore
Achin' in sores
Babylon, the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where there's no repentance there can be no admission
And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Saddam and Minister Farrakhan
What's goin' on, what's a priority to you
By what authority do to you
The majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Recapture the land
Remove the mark from off of our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his command
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned, let them with ears understand

Beware the false motives of others

To shoot you down in the name of ambition, they do

Sick of men trying to pull strings like Geppetto

March through these streets like Soweto, uhh

Jesus and Judas, backstabbers do this
Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do
Forgive them, Father, for

It took me a little while to discover
Wolves in sheep coats who pretend to be lovers
Men who lack conscience will even lie to themselves, to themselves
A friend once said, and I found to be true
That everyday people, they lie to God too
So what makes you think, that they won't lie to you?

Forgive them, Father, for
They know not what they do (Forgive them, forgive them)

Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

I need you, baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm a lonely night

But way before the record deals
Streets that nurtured Lauryn Hill
Made sure that I'd never go too far

Every ghetto, every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days, in New Jerusalem

Story starts in Hootaville
Grew up next to Ivy Hill
When kids were stealing quartervilles for fun
""Kill the Guy"" in Carter Park
Rode a Mongoose 'til it's dark
Watching kids show off the stolen ones

Every ghetto, every city
And suburban place I been
Make me recall my days, in the New Jerusalem

Bag of Bontons, twenty cents and a nickel (well that's a quarter)
Springfield Ave. had the best popsicles
Saturday morning cartoons and Kung-Fu (wuh-TAH!)
Main street roots tonic with the dreads
A beef patty and some coco bread
Move the patch from my Lee's to the tongue of my shoes
'Member, Freling-Huysen used to have the bomb leather
Back when Doug Fresh and Slick Rick was together
Looking at the crew, we thought we'd all live forever

Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
You know it's hot

Looking back, looking back, looking back, looking back
Drill teams on Munn street
'Member when Hawthorne and Chancellor had beef
Moving Records was on Central Ave
I was there at dancing school
South Orange Ave. at Borlin pool
Unaware of what we didn't have
Writing my friends' names on my jeans with a marker
July 4th races outside Parker
Fireworks at Martin Stadium
The Untouchable P.S.P
Where all them crazy niggas be
And car thieves got away through Irvington (skrrrt, lock it up, uh)
Hillside brings beef with the cops
Self Destruction record drops
And everybody's name was Muslim (children playing, women producing)
Sensations and eighty-eight
Attracted kids from out of state
And everybody used to do the wop (wop it out, wop it out, wop it out)
Jack ya, jack ya, jack ya body
Nah, the BizMark used to amp up the party
I wish those days, they didn't stop

On exactly what an artist should be
Should they be someone with prosperity

All I wanted was to sell like five hundred
And be a ghetto superstar since my first album, Blunted
I used to work at Foot Locker, they fired me: I fronted
Or I quitted, now I spit it, however do you want it?
Now you get it!
Writing rhymes, in the Range, with the frames lightly tinted
Then send it to your block and have my full name cemented (Lauryn Hill!)
And if your lines sound like mine I'm taking a percentage (ka-ching!)
Unprecedented, and still respected when it's vintage
I'm serious, I'm takin' over areas in Aquarius
Runnin' red lights with my ten thousand chariots
Just as Christ was a Superstar, you stupid, star!
They'll hail you then nail you, no matter who you are
They'll make you now then take you down, and make you face it
If you slit the bag open, put your pinky in it and taste it

LAURYN HILL,"Oh Jerusalem
Oh Jerusalem

Realizing that there's no place else to go
And there's nobody I know who can help me
Textbook solutions are so improbable
'Cause everybody else is just as empty

Naked as the day that I was born, I tried to hide
Behind education and philosophy
Hopeless explanation to describe a situation
I can't see because the world's on top of me

Oh, wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death?
Freeing me from dust and the superficial trust
Of an enemy that seeks to take my breath
Failing to connect 'cause I'm morally defect
By reason of the God inside my head
Causing me to see only what pertains to me
Believing I'm alive when I'm still dead
Limited to earth, unable to find out my worth
'Cause I can't see past my own vanity
If I'm not included, then I just have to remove it
From my mind because it has to be insanity

Oh, wretched man that I am, who will deliver me
From the body of this death?

Can I even factor, that I've only been an actor
In this staged interpretation of this day
Focused on the shadow, with my back turned to the light
Too intelligent to see it's me in the way
What a paradox, having God trapped in a box
All this time professing to be spiritual
Naturally pretending that I'm actually defending
God through my facade, don't need material

[Hook]
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection
Submit to truth, leave the deception of thy youth
So we could walk in the council of authority
Forget the proof, our generation so aloof
Only follow in the steps of the majority

Trust in the Lord with all thy heart
And lay not to thine, oh an understanding in all thy ways
Acknowledge Him and He shall direct our paths
Be not wise in thine own eyes and you can follow him

We judge and condemn, just as ignorant as them
Who religion tells us that we should ignore
Perpetrating we're in covenant with Him
Exposed by the very things that we adore

We grin and shake hands, then lay ambush for the man
Who has a different point of view then us
Infuriated 'cause he doesn't understand
Bringing up those things we don't want to discuss

Why still do evil? We don't know how to do good
Walking on in darkness running from the light, hey
Led to believe, because we live in neighborhoods
Telling us what's going on will be alright
Oh, so repressed, so convinced that I was blessed
When I played with my game of Monopoly
Oh, to suggest that my life is still a mess
Who reveal the pride I'm hiding is what's stopping me

[Hook]
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem, keeping thee from perfection

Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear
Fruit of itself except in the vine
I am the vine, ye are the branches, he that live in me
And I in him, the same bring forth much fruit
For without me, you can do nothing
Oh Jerusalem, you're traditions have deceived you
I've chosen you, you haven't chosen me
Do whatsoever, you asking my name he may give to you

But in vain they call my name, teaching doctrines just the same
Justified among themselves
But God know with the heart, what man esteemed as smart
Is an abomination to Emmanuel

Just repent, turn from selfish motivation
So iniquity will not cause your demise
Make you a new heart and a new spirit
For why would he die? Oh Jerusalem, please tell me why

I have no pleasure in the death of him to die
Says the Lord God where forth turn yourselves and live
It's not the talkers, but the walkers and His Word
Are the only ones the Father will forgive

[Hook]
Oh Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness
That thou mayest be saved from thy deception
How long shall thy faith lodge lies within thee?
Oh Jerusalem, providing no protection

Who will dominate opinions
Schizims and isms
Keeping us in forms of religion
Conforming our vision

Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee elections
Moral infection
Epidemic Lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the higest possible order
Distorting our tape recorders
From hearing like under water
Beyond the borders
Finding sin in disorder
Bound by the strategy
And systemic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate worse than Sodom
What's got 'em drunk off the spirit?
Truth comes and we can't hear it
And you've been programmed to fear it
I had a vision
I was falling in indecision
Appalling
Calling religion some program on television
How can dominant wisdom
Be recognized in a system
Of anti-christs and majority rules
Intelligent Fools

Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors of Past illusions

The Bloodshed or the Male?

Blocked from mercy
Bitter than Ceres
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat, we would eat
And still dine at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong to true enemy's defeat
Destitute a necessity
Causing desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'till there was nothing left of me
Realizing the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only option supernatural circumcision
Inwardly
Only water can purge the hearts from words
The firey darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts
Iniquity
Shaping in
There's no escaping when
Your whole philosiphy is paper thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Can it be all of humanity
Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow
Making love with a whore
Aching in sores
Babylon the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social socercery

Where's there's no repentance there can be no remission
And that sentence more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb and Sudam and Minister Farakhan

The sweetest thing I've ever known
Was like the kiss on the collarbone
The soft caress of happiness
The way you walk, your style of dress
I wish I didn't get so weak
Ooh, baby, just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me

See like a queen, a queen upon her throne
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I've known

I get mad when you walk away
(Don't walk away from me, c'92mon now)
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own

By what I had been chosen to perform

Told me to kneel down and pray
For unto me a man child would be born

But everybody told me to be smart
Look at your career they said
""Lauryn baby, use your head""
But instead I chose to use my heart

Now the joy of my world is in Zion
Now the joy of my world is in Zion

How beautiful if nothing more
Than to wait at Zion's door
I've never been in love like this before
Now let me pray to keep you from
The perils that will surely come

Goddamn right I miss drinking
Yeah, I do

But I've been up late nights
Staring at the street lights
All the cigarette smoke, can't escape a closing window
And my head's like ""What happened to, it's alright?""
Baby, It's not alright
What if we're a closing window?

But I can't shake the feeling
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high
I can't shake the feeling (I can't shake the feeling)
Do you picture a better life?

I found myself up late feeling kinda jealous
Looking at the bullshit, other people's wellness
And it's got me thinking
It's just not you (not you)
I've been all night looking in the eyes of my baby
Right in front of me, what a gift, so amazing
Oh, that's what's true
But I stay up late night
Screaming at the street lights
All the cigarette smoke, filling up these hopeless lungs
Oh, and my head's like ""What happened to, it's alright?""
(What'92s happened?)
Baby, It's not alright
I feel like a closing window

But I can't shake the feeling (No, I can't shake the feeling)
That you picture a better life, better wife, better nights, better high
I can't shake the feeling (I can't shake the feeling, my baby)
Do you picture a better life?

I can't seem to understand it
How did we get so low?
No, no, no
I can't seem to understand it
How did we get so low? (How?)
No, no, no

You throw your head back and you spit in the wind
Let the walls crack, 'cause it lets the light in
Let 'em drag you through hell
They can't tell you to change who you are

Put your sword down, dive right into the pain
Stay unfiltered and loud, you'll be proud of that skin full of scars

So you might give yourself away, yeah
And pay full price for each mistake
But when the candy-coating hides the razor blade
You can cut yourself loose and use that rage

People will pretend but baby girl, nobody knows
And even I can't teach you how to fly
But I can show you how to live like your life is on the line

Young emotions that just won't grow up

I keep hiding the keys in all these
Places even I can't find
Hoping, one day, you'll find them all
And I wanna let you see inside my attic

Inside this olive skin are paper thin
Illusions that I'm tougher than I am
And I'm guarded, castle walls from all the falls
And break up calls and never should've beens

But don't go pushing too hard
I'm not so easy to manipulate
I will give you all of my secrets
If you promise you can brave my attic

And I swear, not tryna be vindictive
I'm just terrified that you might see me different
You'll change your mind, tell me that I'm crazy
Tell me that I'm okay, tell me that you'll stay
'Cause my attic is silver plans and one night stands
That numbers can't begin to calculate
My attic is up the stairs and waiting there
Are lonely nights, they keep me wide awake

I keep hiding the keys in all these
Places even I can't find
Hoping, one day, you'll find them all

'I'92m Not Dead'



There's always cracks
A crack of sunlight
A crack in the mirror or on your lips
It's the morning on a sunset Friday
When all conversations twist
It's the fifth day of ice on a new tattoo
But the ice should be on our heads
We only spun the web to catch ourselves
So we weren't left for dead

And I was never lookin' for approval from anyone but you
And though this journey's over, I'd go back if you ask me to

I'm not dead, just floating
Right between the ink on your tattoo
In the belly of the beast we turned into
I'm not scared, just changing
Right behind the cigarette and the devilish smile
You're my crack of sunlight
You can do the math a thousand ways, but you can't erase the facts
That others come and others go, but you always come back
I'm the winter flower underground, always thirsty for summer rain
And just like the change of seasons
I know you'll be back again

I'm not dead, just floating
Underneath the ink of my tattoo
I've tried to hide my scars from you
I'm not scared, just changing
Right behind the cigarette and the devilish smile
You're my crack of sunlight, oh

I'm not dead just yet
I'm not dead, I'm just floating
Doesn't matter where I'm going
I'll find you (I'm not scared at all)
Underneath the cuts and bruises
Finally gained what no one loses
I'll find you (I will find you)

And darlin', I know it's getting late
So what do you say we leave this place?

Walk me home in the dead of night
I can't be alone with all that's on my mind, mhm
So say you'll stay with me tonight
'Cause there is so much wrong goin' on outside

There's somethin' in the way I wanna cry
That makes me think we'll make it out alive
So come on and show me how we're good
I think that we could do some good, mhm

'Fuckin'92 Perfect'


Bad decisions, that's alright
Welcome to my silly life

Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood
Miss ""Knowing it's all good'94 it didn't slow me down
Mistaken, always second guessing
Underestimated, look, I'm still around

Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

You're so mean (You're so mean) when you talk (When you talk)
About yourself, you were wrong
Change the voices (Change the voice) in your head (In your head)
Make them like you instead

So complicated, look how we all make it
Filled with so much hatred, such a tired game
It's enough, I've done all I can think of
Chased down all my demons, I've seen you do the same, oh-oh
Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me

The whole world's scared, so I swallow the fear
The only thing I should be drinking is an ice-cold beer
So cool in line, and we try, try, try
But we try too hard, and it's a waste of my time
Done looking for the critics, 'cause they're everywhere
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair
Exchange ourselves and we do it all the time
Why do we do that? Why do I do that?
Why do I do that?
Yeah, oh, oh
Pretty, pretty, pretty
Yeah-eh

Pretty, pretty please, don't you ever, ever feel
Like you're less than fuckin' perfect
Pretty, pretty please, if you ever, ever feel
Like you're nothing, you're fuckin' perfect to me
[Outro]
Yeah
You're perfect, you're perfect
